The female employment rate in Lativa was 5.9 percentage points higher than the average among member States of the European Union and was the eighth highest among all member States. The largest gender gap in employment was observed in households with small children: the employment rate among women with children was only 75.3%,3 compared to 93.4% among men, a gap of 18.1 percentage points (see figure I). Women\u2019s involvement in full-time unpaid care of children in the household was greater than that of men, and as a result their opportunites for employment were reduced. Among women working part-time in Latvia, 20% reported that looking after children or older adults was the main reason for choosing a part-time job, and 23.1% of all economically inactive women reported the same reason for not being in paid employment.4 This pattern of employment among women with children is likely to lead to economic dependency upon family or friends, and can also result in income insufficiency in old age.5\n",

Among women with small children, 12.9% were working part-time, compared with only 1.8% of men. The gap remained in households with older or no children, indicating that women were more engaged in part-time employment regardless of household structure (see figure IX). \n",
