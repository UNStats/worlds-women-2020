Compared to other jobs, these types of jobs are more often associated with irregular low income or no income at all, resulting in lower proportions of women receiving cash labor income. For instance, among 39 countries with available data in developing regions, 61% of married women aged 15\u201449 employed in the past 12 months were paid only in cash. The proportion of those paid only in cash among married men aged 15\u201449 and employed in the past 12 months was 70%, resulting in a gender gap of nine percentage points. An additional 14% of women and of men were paid in cash and in-kind, resulting in a gender parity among those with this type of earnings (see figure I).\nA gender gap of similar magnitude was observed in sub-Saharan Africa, where 57% of married women were paid only in cash and 15% were paid in cash and in kind (vs. 65% and 16% of men, respectively). \n                \n",

For men, the proportion varied from 23% in Ethiopia to 98% in South Africa.
