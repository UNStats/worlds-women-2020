In 2016, in 139 Member States, men were more likely than women to disagree that it was acceptable for women in their families to have a paid job outside the home if they wanted to do so (20% of men versus 14% of women, respectively). The gender gap increased when there were children in the household, swaying men\u2019s attitudes more negatively than women\u2019s: 25% of men versus 16% of women in households with children, respectively, disagreed with the above statement.1 When asked, 29% of men and 27% of women stated that they preferred women in their families to stay at home rather than work at a paid job or to do both.\nIn 2016, disapproval of women in paid employment outside the home was more prevalent among men than women in 111 out of 139 (80%) Member States and territories with available data. Disapproval was five or more percentage points higher among women than men in only three countries: Haiti (nine percentage points), Slovenia (eight percentage points) and Togo (five percentage points) (see figure I).\n",
