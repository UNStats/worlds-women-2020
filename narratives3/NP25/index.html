                <li>During the period 1997—2012, marriage of girls before age 18 decreased from 13.5% to 8.4%; marriage of girls before age 15 decreased from around 1% to almost zero over the same period.</li>
                <li> The five-fold increase in the rate of marriage of girls younger than age 15 observed during the period 2012—2017 resulted from a number of factors, including poverty and population growth owing to the influx of foreigners into the country as a result of armed conflicts in neighbouring countries.</li>
                <li> Of the 77,700 marriage contracts issued in 2017, 13.4%, involved girls under age 18. After the adoption of new regulations in 2018, the number of child marriage contracts dropped significantly, by 27% compared to 2017.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><a href=#NP21 class="narrative-ref">Child marriage</a> is a form of violence against girls, which deprives them of their legitimate human rights, including their right to education, to make an informed choice of a life partner and to build positive family relationships. Lack of such rights has a negative effect on the quality of girls' lives, their reproductive health and their ability to find decent work.</p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p><strong>After years of significant and steady decrease, child marriage spiked in 2017 </strong></p>
            <p>Analysis of data from thePopulation and Family and Health Survey in Jordan shows that there was a significant and steady decrease in the percentage of women married before age 15 and before age 18 during the period 1997—2012 (see figure I):<span class="footnote-index">1</span> child marriage before age 18 decreased from 13.5% to 8.4% while marriage before age 15 decreased from around 1% to almost zero (0.3%). That decrease was due to amendments made to the Provisional Personal Status Law No. 82 in 2001 to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18.</p>
            <p>However, early marriage among women aged 20—24, particularly those who married before age 15, increased significantly in recent years (a five-fold increase between 2012 and 2017), from almost zero to 1.5%. During the same period, the proportion of women aged 20—24 who married before age 18 registered a moderate increase, from 8.4% to 9.7%. The increase in child marriage in Jordan between 2012 and 2017 resulted from a number of factors, including poverty and population growth owing to the influx of foreigners into Jordan as a result of armed conflicts in neighbouring countries.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
