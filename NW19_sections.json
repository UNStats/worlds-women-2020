        "content": "\nYoung women not in employment, education or training are engaged in unpaid care and domestic work1\nYoung people aged 15\u201429 are in a critical period of transition from youth to the beginning of adulthood, an opportune time for the elimination of gender inequalities. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have not yet succeeded, however, in ensuring that both young women and men have the same rights and opportunities in education, vocational training and labour market integration.\nIt is estimated that 25.7% of young people in the region between the ages of 15\u201429 do not benefit from the main pillars of social inclusion, the education system and labour market, and that most are women (67.9%). Target 8.6 of Sustainable Development Goal 8 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development2 is aimed at the reducing the number of young people not in employment, education or training [link to NW18]. With this in mind, there is an urgent need for information that explains the barriers to the integration of young women into the education system and their participation in the labour market.\nThe fact that girls and young women are expected to undertake heavy domestic work, resulting in long-lasting consequences for all aspects of their lives, was recognized in the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted in 1995.3 In Latin America and the Caribbean, more than half of young women who are not in school or in employment (57.8%) spend their time on unpaid care and domestic work, while most young men in this situation (61.8%) are unemployed. Furthermore, less than one fourth of young people aged 15\u201429 in the region are studying or in training (see figure I).\nA similar scenario is evident, and more prominent, among the subgroup aged 25\u201429, where 36.8% of women are outside the labour market and not in education or training and 12.4% of men are in the same situation. In this subgroup, a larger proportion of young women (66.1%) are engaged in unpaid domestic and care work, with a smaller proportion of women (3.7%) and men (3%) studying or in training. Regardless of the age group, a trend is clear: most of young people work and are either paid (mainly the case for men) or unpaid (primarily the case for women), showing a trend of early and unequal division of labour by sex.\n",

        "content": "\nGovernments in Latin America and the Caribbean have identified the division of labour by sex and unfair social organization of care as one of the four structural challenges to the achievement of gender equality by 2030.4 The social distribution of the burden of care continues to be unfair and unbalanced, with heavy implications in terms of the equality gap between men and women. According to the information gathered from time-use surveys, adolescent girls (aged 15\u201419) spend more hours per week on work, both paid and unpaid, than adolescent boys, which reflects the limited time available to adolescent girls for educational activities, leisure and recreational activities or sports and community participation. At the same time, pregnancy and motherhood in adolescent girls (around 13% of women ages 15\u201419 were mothers according to the last available census information) is another major obstacle to women\u2019s autonomy during their teen years and into early adulthood. This problem is rooted, inter alia, in cultural patterns that associate women with motherhood and the resulting search for social approval or inclusion by having children; the lack of national policies on sexual and reproductive health education; the scarcity of specialized health services adapted to the needs of adolescent girls; and difficulties in addressing the power relationships in couples and making informed decisions about contraception.5\nData on the activity status of young people aged 15\u201429 show differences between men and women in households with children under age 15. Most young women living with children in their households are not engaged in employment, education or training (39.9%) while men living in households with children tend to be employed (61.3%) (see figure II).\n",
