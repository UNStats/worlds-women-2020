<li>Globally, as of 2020, 180 out of 188 (96%) Member States and territories have at least one legal barrier restricting women&#8217;s opportunities in economic structures, participation in productive activities and access to resources.</li>
<li>In only eight countries in Europe and Northern America are women and men on an equal legal footing with respect to the full set of key topics assessed, which are structured around women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s interactions with formal laws and regulations during their economic life cycle.</li>
<li>In countries in developed regions, legal gender gaps impeding women&#8217;s rights are not significant, but in some countries in developing regions women have a fraction of the economic rights of men as a result of discriminatory laws and regulations that obstruct their economic empowerment.</li>
<li>While countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have made tremendous progress in terms of women&#8217;s legal rights over the last 25 years, women&#8217;s legal rights are still far from being fully guaranteed in countries in Western Asia and Northern Africa.</li>
<li>Although far from universality, significant gains (almost 30 percentage points) have been achieved in the adoption of protective legislation ensuring equal pay for work of equal value: in 1995, eight (6%) countries in developing regions legally required employers to pay women and men the same remuneration, by 2020, 48 (34%) countries had adopted such protective laws.</li>
<li>Paid parental leave, available to both mothers and fathers, while unknown in national legislation in 1995, had been mandated by law in only seven countries (5%) by 2020.</li>

Research shows that while international conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women<span class="footnote-index">3</span> and women&#8217;s political representation at the national level have played a role in closing legal gaps in women&#8217;s economic rights, legal barriers have remained in a number of countries owing to conflict situations and weak rule of law.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>

However, in some Member States and territories in developing regions there have been positive changes in women&#8217;s legal rights over the past 25 years, signifying an improved regulatory environment for women&#8217;s economic independence (see figure).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_116.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>It appears that the number of Member States and territories in developing regions with equal legal rights for women and men on selected key issues has reached a plateau, at around 130 States, over the past 25 years. In countries in <span class="label-ref">Western Asia and Northern Africa</span>, the achievement of equal legal rights for women is significantly behind what has been realized in other regions. Countries in <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> have made tremendous progress, catching up with developed regions in terms of women&#8217;s legal rights.<span class="footnote-index">5</span></p>
<p>Though still far from reaching universality, significant gains have been achieved in terms of legislation to address the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/733303cb424641cf9f3ae89ea97874d2#NW21" target="_blank">gender pay gap</a>: by 2020, employers were legally required to pay equal remuneration for women and men who performed work of equal value in 48 (34%) Member States and territories in developing regions, compared with just eight (6%) in 1995.

In light of the fact that in 1995 not one country in the world provided paid parental leave for both mothers and fathers, this increase shows minimal progress towards ensuring women&#8217;s right to work.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>These indicators provide information on the number of United Nations Member States and territories with equal legal rights for women and men on selected issues and on the number of Member States and territories with legal barriers restricting women&#8217;s opportunities in economic structures, participation in productive activities and access to resources. Only formal laws and regulations are taken into account; religious and customary laws are not considered unless they are codified. The implementation of laws is not measured by these indicators.</p>
