<li>In 2020, women are free under the law to participate in political activity in all countries worldwide, although significant obstacles to their effective access to parliament remain, including: gender stereotypes; unequal access to resources and education; unequal social and legal status; and violence and harassment perpetrated against women in politics and women aspirants to political office.&#8211;</li>
<li>Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in women&#8217;s access to parliament, with slow but steady progress in representation over the past 25 years. From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rose from 11.3% to 24.9%. Improvement appears to have slowed down, however, since 2015 &ndash; and currently,&#8211;in 2020, women hold at least 50% of the seats in only four national parliaments.</li>
<li>From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved in recent years in Australia and New Zealand, Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe and Northern America. However, Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zealand, continues to lag behind, with only 6% of parliamentary seats being held by women.</li>
<li>To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of targeted policy and legal measures to increase women&#8217;s representation in national parliaments.&#8211;Of the 20 countries with the highest percentages of women in parliament, 16 apply some type of gender quota.</li>
<li>Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as president or&#8211;speaker&#8211;of the house.&#8211;Although the percentage of female presiding officers of parliament almost doubled, from 10.5% in 1995 to 20.5% in 2020, it is still too low to influence policymaking effectively.</li>
<li>Women continue to be underrepresented in key decision-making positions in parliaments, with the exception of gender equality committees, 73% of which are chaired by women.</li>

</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Women&#8217;s representation in national parliaments and in key decision-making positions in parliament is an essential aspect of their participation in political and public life: their representation is a human right and a prerequisite for genuine&#8211;democracy,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> sustainable development and peace.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women contributes to good governance and gender equality in society.</p>
<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament and in parliamentary leadership allows for the prominent placement of their concerns&#8211;&#8211;on political agendas, and for the introduction of fresh priorities through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws relevant to women&#8217;s issues.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> The full political participation of women requires that they occupy key positions of influence, as envisioned by the Plan of Action for Gender-sensitive Parliaments adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in&#8211;2012.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>

<p>Women face discrimination within the family, the economy and society, as well as under the law. A male-dominated political culture, persisting gender stereotypes that confine women to the private sphere, unequal access to resources and education, unequal social and legal status and violence and harassment perpetrated against women in politics and as aspirants to political office need to be tackled in order to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to access political office.<span class="footnote-index">5</span></p>
<p>As emphasized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, increasing attention has been paid to instances of sexism,harassment and gender-based violence against women parliamentarians that may dissuade other women from pursuing a political career and undermine the full participation of women elected to parliament in decision-making processes.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
<p><strong>Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in women&#8217;s access to parliament, with slow but steady progress in representation over the past 25 years.</strong></p>
<p>From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rose from 11.3% to 24.9%, and up until 2015, progress in women&#8217;s representation was continuous over each successive 5-year span, reaching a growth rate of 3.2% between 2010 and 2015. However, from 2015 and 2020, the rate of increase slowed down to 2.7% (see figure I).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_206.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved in recent years in <span class="label-ref">Australia and New Zealand</span>, <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> and <span class="label-ref">Europe and Northern America</span>.</strong> In 2017, Australia and New Zealand surpassed the 30% mark in the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women for the second time, after first reaching that threshold in 2010. In 2019, Latin America and the Caribbean became the second region to surpass the 30% mark, followed by the Europe and Northern America region in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2020, the share of women in national parliaments was the highest in Australia and New Zealand (35.1%), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (32.1%), Europe and Northern America (31%) and Central Asia (25.4%). The other regions were below the global average, significantly so in Western Asia (15.6%), Southern Asia (17.3%), South-Eastern Asia (20.4%) and Eastern Asia (21.6%). Moreover, although minor improvements have been noted over time, the lowest share of women in parliament, 6.2%, continues&#8211;to be in the <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> region, excluding Australia and New Zealand.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_207.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of targeted policy and legal measures to increase women&#8217;s representation in national parliaments.&#8211;</strong>Countries that have adopted special measures generally have higher numbers of women in parliament. While in 1995 only two countries had adopted legislation ensuring gender&#8211;quotas<span class="footnote-index">7</span> for parliamentary elections (Argentina and Nepal), by 2020 over 80 countries had done so.<span class="footnote-index">8</span></p>
<p>In 2019, overall, women won 25.8% of seats in 68 parliamentary chambers up for renewal in 55 countries.<span class="footnote-index">9</span> In the 40 chambers that applied quotas &ndash; either legislated or voluntarily applied by political parties&#8211;&ndash;&#8211;women gained, on average, 30.3% of seats. In the remaining 28 chambers, which did not apply any form of quota, only 17.9% of seats were won by women.</p>
<p>Other key factors include policies to promote women&#8217;s recruitment by political parties, strong women&#8217;s movements, including women&#8217;s youth groups, awareness-raising efforts and a more gender-sensitive political culture.</p>
</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Over the past 25 years, the top countries in terms of women&#8217;s participation in parliament have become a much more diverse group.</strong>&#8211;In 1995, 8 out of the 10 top-ranking countries were located in Europe (the other two being in Africa and Latin America).&#8211;<strong>In 2020, the group included five countries from&#8211;the <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> region</strong>, two European countries, two countries from sub-Saharan Africa and one country from the Northern Africa and Western Asia region (see table 1).</p>
<p>In 2020, only four countries have thus far reached or surpassed the parity line of 50% representation by women in parliament: Rwanda (61.3%), Cuba (53.2%), Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (53.1%) and the United Arab Emirates (50.0%). Women&#8217;s representation in eight countries followed closely: Mexico (48.2%), Nicaragua (47.3%), Sweden (47.0%), Grenada (46.7%), Andorra (46.4%), South Africa (46.3%), Finland (46.0%) and Costa Rica (45.6%).<span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>

They also need to be positive role models for other women, work to change parliamentary procedures and, ultimately, support women&#8217;s rights and pursue gender equality (see table 2).</p>

Women currently chair 26% of foreign affairs, defence, finance, human rights and gender equality committees combined, but their share varies significantly by committee type, from 73% of gender equality committees to just over 10% of defence committees. Data for the reporting period show that women chair approximately 33% of human rights committees, 20% of foreign affairs committees and 13% of finance committees (see figure IV).</p>

<p>Article 7 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women provides that &#8220;States Parties shall (…) ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right: (a) To vote in all elections and public referenda and to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies; (b) To participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the last 25-year span, from 1995 to 2020, the most significant progress in the achievement of women&#8217;s equal representation in parliament has been made in Rwanda (+ 57%), the United Arab Emirates (+50%), Andorra (+ 42.8%) and the Plurinational State of Bolivia (+42.3%), respectively, in their lower or single houses. In 1995, the top country (Sweden) had 40% of seats held by women in parliament. In 2020, in the top country (Rwanda), over 60% of seats in the lower house are held by women.</p>
