          <div class="content">
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li>
                Although higher proportions of women in decision-making roles in
                the private sector has a positive correlation to superior
                corporate profitability, the proportion of women in managerial
                positions remains low in both the public and private sectors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Globally, women held only 28% of managerial positions in 2019,
                with some regional variations, and in countries in Northern
                Africa and Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia the
                proportion barely reached 13%, a statistic that has not changed
                significantly over the past 20 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since 2000, while the proportion of women in managerial
                positions has increased in most regions, the rate of improvement
                is slight.
              </li>
              <li>
                The underrepresentation of women in management positions is even
                more visible at the higher levels of decision-making: 48% of
                companies surveyed by the International Labour Organization
                (ILO) in 2018<span class="footnote-index">1</span> had at least
                one woman in senior management, but only 31% had women in top
                executive positions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Women CEOs or top managers are even more scarce: only 18% of
                enterprises surveyed by the World Bank had a woman CEO.
              </li>
              <li>
                Among Fortune 500 corporations,&#8211;women accounted for only
                7.4%, or 37 out of 500 CEOs. Despite the minor improvement from
                1998, when only 1 out of the top 500 corporations had a female
                CEO, the gender gap at the level of top corporate decision
                makers remains significant.
              </li>
              <li>
                The bigger the enterprise, the lower the chances of it having a
                woman CEO: over 26% of small enterprises&#8211;surveyed by ILO
                in 2018 (employing 2 to 100 workers)&#8211;had female CEOs,
                compared with 16% of large enterprises&#8211;(employing more
                than 250 workers).&#8211;&#8211;
              </li>
              <li>
                Enterprises with more women in their workforce are more likely
                to have a female CEO. Of the enterprises surveyed by ILO in
                2018, enterprises with a&#8211;gender balanced workforce were
                15% more likely to have a female CEO; and enterprises with a
                predominantly female workforce (between 61% and 100%) were 22%
                more likely to have a female CEO.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Gender diversity in managerial positions, as evidenced by greater
              representation of women in senior roles, as CEOs and senior-level
              managers, is not just about human rights and social equality. A
              number of studies have shown that a higher proportion of women in
              decision-making roles in the private sector has had a positive
              effect, boosting stock market returns and creating superior
              corporate profitability.<span class="footnote-index">2</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A global survey of enterprises conducted by ILO in 2018 reaffirmed
              that company profits increase as a result of gender diversity and
              equality initiatives.<span class="footnote-index">3</span>
              Nevertheless, the proportion of women in managerial positions
              remains low in both the public and private sectors, and the number
              of women fall as they move up the corporate ladder towards the top
              executive positions.

              Since 2000, the proportion of women in managerial positions has
              increased in all regions, although their numbers remain
              disproportionately low and overall there has only been a slight
              improvement. In particular, female managers in countries in
              <span class="label-ref">Central and Southern Asia</span> and
              <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span>
              have remained in the minority over the last 20 years, with the
              share of all managerial positions held by women at between only 9%
              and 13% (see figure II).

              management. In countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
              however, where the proportion of women managers tends to be the
              highest, there are some country variations in the proportion of
              women in top management positions, relative to their overall share
              in management (see figure III).

              The finding that fewer women than men are represented at the
              higher levels of management is also supported by an ILO survey
              conducted in 2018,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> which
              collected a sample of almost 13,000 companies in 70 countries

            <p>
              The survey showed that more than 60% of companies had at least one
              woman in supervisory, junior or administrative management and
              middle management. However, at the senior echelons, there were
              very few women: only 48% of companies had at least one woman in
              senior management, and less than a third had women in top
              executive positions (see figure IV).

            <p>
              The glass ceiling at senior managerial levels has created
              occupational segregation within management functions. As of 2018,
              even though 63% of surveyed enterprises had at least one female
              middle manager and close to 50% of surveyed enterprises had at
              least one female senior manager, when looking at their functional
              responsibilities, women were over represented in support
              management functions, such as human resources, finance and
              administration, while managerial posts in the areas of research
              and development and profit-and-loss management, which are
              considered to be more strategic, were generally occupied by men.

            <p>
              At top managerial positions, among enterprises with a CEO, less
              than a fifth have a woman in that position.<span

              Variations exist across regions, however, with countries in

              reporting the highest proportion of enterprises with female top

              The link between the size of a company and the likelihood that it
              will have a woman as CEO is not straightforward. While large
              companies have higher profiles, and may thus be less likely to
              discriminate against women candidates for top managerial
              positions, they also tend to be more hierarchical, making it more
              difficult for women to reach those positions as they may fall
              behind men in terms of networks, training and relevant job
              experience.<span class="footnote-index">9</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, recent evidence shows that the proportion of
              enterprises with a female CEO shrinks as the size of an enterprise
              grows: over 26% of small enterprises (employing 2&ndash;100
              workers) have female CEOs, compared with 20% of medium-sized
              enterprises (employing 101&ndash;250 workers) and 16% of large
              enterprises (employing more than 250 workers)<span

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              This argument is also supported by the historical data on the
              number of female CEOs on the list of the Fortune 500,<span
                class="footnote-index"
                >11</span

              America. While the list from 2020 has more female CEOs than ever
              before, women only account for 7.4% of the total number: only 37
              out of 500 CEOs are women (see figure VII).
            </p>
            <p>
              While this shows an improvement from 1998, when only 1 out of the
              top 500 corporations had a female CEO, the gender gap remains
              significant and is even more pronounced than among large
              enterprises, where in 2018 the share of women CEOs was reported at
