</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Financial decision-making is a fundamental element among the many dimensions of intra-household power<span class="footnote-index">1</span></strong></p>
<p>Gender inequalities in the public sphere often reflect unequal power relations between women and men within the household. Policies aimed at reducing gender inequality are likely to be more effective if they consider the underlying origins of disparities relating to the balance of power and decision-making within the home.</p>
<p>Realizing goals in nearly all areas of public and private life depends on access to and control over financial resources. Data on household financial decision-making provide valuable information on individual agency and the empowerment of women across societies. This topic has direct policy relevance for social welfare and development programmes aimed at increasing economic well-being through income transfers, the outcomes of which depend on access to income. Information on household financial decision-making can also shed light on the distribution of responsibilities among women and men within households.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Women in Europe manage day-to-day expenses</strong></p>
<p>In developed countries, a large majority of women participate in decision-making about household purchases. Recent surveys indicate that in Australia and in 12 countries in Europe decisions about occasional more expensive purchases are largely egalitarian. On average, more than 80% of women and men indicated that decisions about expensive purchases are shared equally between partners.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
<p>The situation with regard to decision-making on routine purchases for the household is quite different. In most countries with available data, decisions about day-to-day household purchases are most frequently taken by women alone (see figure I). While participation in financial decision-making is an important marker of the empowerment of women, sole responsibility in this area may not be desirable. Sustainable Development Goal 5, target 5.4, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for &#8220;the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family&#8221;. That women perceive themselves as being principally responsible for decisions about routine purchases may indicate an imbalance in the management of domestic tasks. Responsibility for deciding how to spend money on food, clothing and items for daily living may reflect obligation rather than autonomy or influence; the responsibility for deciding on how money is spent on a car, home remodelling or a vacation may be more indicative of power.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_87.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4>Gender differences in perceptions of decision-making</h4><div class="content"><p>Most male respondents agreed that their female partners are more likely to be primarily responsible for decisions about routine purchases, although there are differing perceptions of the degree to which decision-making is mutual. Male respondents were much more likely than female respondents to perceive household decisions on routine purchases as being shared. Across 13 countries with available data, 54% of male respondents indicated that decisions about routine household purchases are made jointly with a partner, however, only 28% of female respondents interpreted the sharing of decision-making in this way (see figure II).</p>
<p>Gender differences in perceptions about decision-making provide support for the methodological recommendation that surveys including questions about intra-household power and decision-making should interview respondents privately, whenever possible.</p>
