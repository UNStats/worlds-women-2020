<li>Acceptance of wife-beating is generally higher in countries in Africa, Asia and Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zealand, and lower in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe.</li>
<li>Intimate partner violence is becoming less acceptable. During the 8-year period from 2012 to 2019, women&#8217;s acceptance of physical violence by their partners decreased in almost 75% of countries with trend data.</li>
<li>Younger men view physical violence against their partners as more acceptable than older men.</li>
<li>Although it may be assumed that wife-beating is more widely justified by men than women, in the 53 countries with data on the attitudes of women and men, reported acceptance rates were actually lower among men than women in 40 countries.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Although it should be universally understood that physical violence is never an acceptable practice, unfortunately, in many parts of the world both men and women still believe that wife-beating is justifiable and/or acceptable under certain circumstances. Specific survey questions on wife-beating<span class="footnote-index">1</span> are designed to capture the social justification of violence as a disciplinary action when a woman does not comply with certain expected gender roles.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation
</h4><div class="content"><p>In some countries and cultures, wife-beating is seen as justifiable and/or acceptable in a wide range of contexts, a fact that makes it difficult to change behaviour patterns and creates a challenging situation for women victims of domestic violence who want to talk to someone about their experiences and/or to ask for help. Research indicates that perpetration of and victimization by violence is higher among those who accept or justify such abuse than those who do not.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_295.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Wife-beating remains acceptable in some countries throughout the world: reported levels of acceptance were generally higher in countries in <span class="label-ref">Africa</span>, <span class="label-ref">Asia</span> and <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and lower in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe. Levels of acceptance among women ranged from 2% in Uruguay (2013) to 80% in <span class="label-ref">Afghanistan</span> (2015). Among men, levels of acceptance ranged from 4% in Colombia (2015) and the Dominican Republic (2013) to 72% in <span class="label-ref">Afghanistan</span> (2015) and <span class="label-ref">Papua New Guinea</span> (2017).</p>
<p>It should be noted that it is difficult to compare reported levels of acceptance of wife-beating across countries and contexts because willingness to talk about violence and attitudes towards it vary, a factor that can affect individual response rates. Although it might be assumed that wife-beating is more widely justified by men than women, in the 53 countries with data on the attitudes of both women and men, reported acceptance levels were actually lower among men than women in 40 countries.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Evidence also suggests that attitudes are changing. In 2019, women generally viewed domestic violence as being less acceptable than they had in 2012. Between 2012 and 2019, 15 countries conducted multiple surveys and provided multiple data points for trend analysis on women&#8217;s attitudes towards physical violence: in 11 countries levels of acceptance of wife-beating had decreased, while in the other 4 countries levels of acceptance had increased.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Trend data on men&#8217;s attitudes towards physical violence against women is not widely available, which makes comparable trend analysis challenging. It is possible, however, to look at the differences between the attitudes of <span class="label-ref">adolescents</span> and adult men to see whether attitudes differ across age groups within a given country. Worryingly, data suggest that young men view physical violence against women as more acceptable than older men whereas differences in attitudes by age are less pronounced among women (see table).</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Comparing the attitudes of <span class="label-ref">adolescent</span> males with adult men towards physical violence against women reveals higher levels of acceptance among younger males than among older men: reported levels of acceptance are higher in 40 out of 46 countries (87% of countries with data). In contrast, the attitudes of women towards physical violence against women appear to vary less by age: reported levels are higher among younger women in 45 countries (54% of countries with data) and lower in 38 countries (46% of countries with data).</p>

<h1>About the data</h1>
<h2>Coverage</h2>
<p>Women and men aged 15&ndash;49 worldwide.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>For the years between 2000 and 2019, 99 countries have data on the attitudes of women towards wife-beating, and just over half of those countries (53) also have data on the attitudes of men. Between the years 2012 and 2019, 83 countries collected data on the subject, and 15 of those countries conducted multiple surveys during that same time period.</p>
<p>Oceania (excl) refers to Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) throughout the publication.</p>
