<li>In 2017&#8212;2018, indigenous women in countries with available data in the Latin America and the Caribbean region earned less than women and men of other ethnicities and racial groups, regardless of their education level. Income levels of men were higher in the region than those of women.</li>
<li>Indigenous people tend to be part of larger households, with an average of 4.7 people per household, compared with an average of 3.9 for those who are neither indigenous nor Afrodescendents. The presence of children in the household often increases the hours of unpaid work, particularly for women.</li>
<li>The gender gap in the amount of time spent on unpaid work is the largest among indigenous populations. Indigenous women are overburdened by unpaid work culturally assigned to them: in Ecuador and Mexico, indigenous women may spend up to six additional hours per week on unpaid work than non-indigenous women.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>As stressed in the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, it is crucial to take measures to promote opportunities in the development process for women belonging to ethnic and racial minorities and for indigenous women in order to eradicate dimensions of poverty that affect them.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>
<p>Given that patriarchal cultural patterns and racism are still prevalent in the Latin America and Caribbean region, the intersection of gender, race and indigenous background translates into different levels of income for women and men and people of different races with the same level of education.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Gender inequality intersects and is exacerbated by ethnic-racial inequalities<span class="footnote-index">2</span></strong></p>
<p>Data for six countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region for the period 2017&#8212;2018 on hourly labour income, disaggregated by sex, ethnicity and race and years of schooling, show that <span class="label-ref">indigenous women</span> have lower income levels, regardless of their education level (see figure I). Although academic achievement is associated with higher income levels,<span class="footnote-index">3</span> other factors play an influential role, including gender: income levels are statistically higher for men than for women &#8212; a manifestation of gender inequality. The difference between the wages earned by the most highly educated women and those of their male counterparts is more pronounced when <span class="label-ref">ethnicity and race</span> are factored in: with 13 years of schooling or more, men who are neither indigenous nor Afrodescendents earn the highest incomes, followed by Afrodescendent men, non-indigenous and non-Afrodescendent women, Afrodescendent women, indigenous men and, lastly, indigenous women, who are the most disadvantaged.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_281.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>In Latin America, the notions of race and ethnicity that are part of the political identity of Afrodescendents and indigenous people have made it possible to create the basis for these populations to self-identify in censuses and surveys, and thus to overcome the statistical invisibility that is another form of discrimination.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Data disaggregated by ethnicity and race have shown that average <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/e6d6e1525ef247ef8033c1d0fd0b3a59#NP23" target="_blank">fertility rates</a> for Afrodescendents and indigenous populations are statistically higher than national averages and that of the rest of the population.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> Indigenous people tend to be part of larger households, with an average of 4.7 people per household, compared with an average of 3.9 for those who are neither indigenous nor Afrodescendents. The presence of children in the household often increases the hours of unpaid work of women, and also of men, although not by comparable levels.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
<p>Traditionally, and from early ages, indigenous women, especially in rural areas, are expected to carry out numerous daily tasks that require a large investment of time, such as caring for members of the family and the community, providing households with basic supplies (fetching water or gathering firewood), caring for animals and collaborating on agricultural work. This burden of <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826#NW25" target="_blank">unpaid work</a> limits women&#8217;s ability to fully <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/27c1c1ad540347aabc70434238223919#NW1" target="_blank">participate in the labour market</a>. In addition, as has been well documented, indigenous women, in particualar, are overrepresented among the poor and have less access to productive resources and <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/68c4420b26c04066b787f56b854b9c0b#NW12" target="_blank">land ownership</a>.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
<p>Time-use surveys show that the gender gap in terms of time spend on unpaid work is wider within indigenous populations in all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with available data (see figure II). Indigenous women may spend up to six hours more per week on unpaid work than non-indigenous women, which is the case in Ecuador and Mexico. This underscores the importance of considering the strict gender division of labour in indigenous households, the need for care policies and basic infrastructure to support indigenous families, particularly those living in rural areas, and the barriers to women&#8217;s economic autonomy. For further information on the intersection of gender, household type and unpaid work, the report on the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/e254648c49d04717a98b44d8b203864b#NW7" target="_blank">impact of unpaid work on the economy of Mexican households</a> provides in-depth analysis.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Although time-use surveys in the Latin America and the Caribbean region include questions that allow the self-identification of Afrodescendents, each question poses difficulties for analysis for various reasons, including: sample size (Uruguay); lack of cultural relevance of the questions and activities included in the questionnaires (Colombia and Ecuador); and the lack of measuring care as a component of unpaid domestic work (Brazil). With a view to ensuring that the information obtained describes time-use in Afrodescendent populations, race should be a focus of analysis from the design stage of measurement tools and methodologies.</p>
