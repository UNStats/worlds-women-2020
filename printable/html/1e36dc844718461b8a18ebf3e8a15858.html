</ul>
</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Women play a vital role in policing and contribute, as much as their male colleagues, to providing safe and inclusive communities. Female police officers act as role models for gender equality, inspiring women and girls to advocate for their own rights and to pursue careers in law enforcement. Moreover, female police officers provide a greater sense of security to women and children and improve access and support from law enforcement agencies to all members of the community.</p>
<p>Women police officers utilize a style of policing that relies less on physical force, are better at defusing potentially violent confrontations,are less likely to become involved in the use of excessive force and are more likely to respond effectively to violence against women.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

Although the proportion of women police officers in those countries is higher than in other countries, there are still challenges in ensuring that women are represented at higher levels of management. The Nordic-Baltic Network of Policewomen continues to ask the question: why are women underrepresented in the top and middle management positions and in operational positions in the police force?<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
