              <li>
                According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF)
                and the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 200
                million&#8211;girls and women have undergone FGM based on recent
                data from 31 countries.<span class="footnote-index">1</span

              </li>
              <li>
                FGM is slowly declining in some countries and subregions where
                the practice is prevalent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite recent progress, the prevalence of FGM remains
                alarmingly high in parts of Northern Africa, Eastern
                Africa&#8211;and West Africa.<span class="footnote-index"

              </li>
              <li>
                Because COVID-19 is interrupting programmes to end FGM, progress
                may be threatened.
              </li>
              <li>
                Progress in the elimination of FGM is not universal, and where
                it is taking place it is not fast enough.<span

                  >4</span
                >
                Even in countries where the practice has become less common,
                progress would need to be at least 10 times faster to meet the
                global target of its elimination by 2030.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Female genital mutilation is a violation of the human rights of
              girls and women that affects girls and women worldwide. There is a
              large body of literature documenting the adverse health
              consequences of female genital mutilation over both the short and
              long term: the practice is a direct manifestation of gender
              inequality, which &#8220;constitutes irreparable, irreversible
              harm and is an act of violence against women and
              girls&#8221;.<span class="footnote-index">6</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              While the practice is most concentrated in countries in Africa,
              from the Atlantic coast across to the Horn of Africa, it is also
              practiced in countries in the Middle East, such as Iraq and Yemen,
              in some countries in Asia, and also in some communities in
              Australia, Europe and Northern America.<span

              Female genital mutilation is condemned in international treaties
              and conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of
              All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Declaration on the
              Elimination of Violence Against Women and the Cairo Declaration
              for the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, since FGM is regarded as a traditional practice
              prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases,
              performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of
              the Child. In many countries national legislation includes an
              explicit ban on the practice.

            <p>
              With its inclusion under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target
              5.3, which is aimed at the elimination of this harmful practice by
              2030, FGM holds a prominent position on the global development
              agenda. Although the practice has persisted for centuries, it is
              becoming less common, with a marked decline reported in countries
              such as Egypt where it was once universal, as well as in countries
              such as Kenya, where the practice is restricted to specific ethnic
              communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prevalence rates of FGM vary significantly by country. The latest
              available data on the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-49
              years who have undergone FGM or cutting are shown by country in
              figure I, which highlights the fact that, despite recent progress,
              the prevalence of FGM remains alarmingly high in parts of Northern
              Africa and West Africa.<span class="footnote-index">8</span>
              Moreover, the onset of <span class="label-ref">COVID-19</span> has
              interrupted programmes to end FGM, which could threaten progress
              towards the elimination of the practice.

              Such declines at the country level have contributed to a reduction

              Africa, the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15&ndash;19 years
              who have undergone FGM or cutting decreased by 17.5%, from 91.4%
