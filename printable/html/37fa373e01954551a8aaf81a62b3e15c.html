              <li>
                Women continue to be underrepresented among senior-level civil
                servants: they represented less than 50% of senior-level civil
                servants in 60% of the 27 developed countries with available
                data for the period 2008&ndash;2017.
              </li>
              <li>
                As of June 2020, about a quarter (24%) of national statistical
                offices worldwide were headed by women, close to the proportion
                observed in 2015.
              </li>
              <li>
                Women are underrepresented among senior professionals and
                managers within the United Nations system. Women occupied 44% of
                the total number of appointments for a period of one year or
                more, an improvement compared to 32% of appointments in 1997.
                However, their representation is higher at the junior
                professional levels (above 50%) and declines at higher senior
                professional and management levels (between 30% and 40%).

            <p>
              Women tend to be underrepresented among senior-level civil
              servants, including government administrators, administrators at
              intergovernmental organizations, ambassadors and consuls-general.
              During the period 2008&ndash;2017, the representation of women at
              senior-level civil servant positions was below parity in 60% of
              the 27 developed countries with available data (see figure I).
            </p>
            <p>
              As in the past,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> rates of
              representation varied widely across countries, ranging from 16% to
              77%. Among the four countries with the highest proportions of
              women as senior-level civil servants (above 60%), Hungary (76.6%),
              the Russian Federation (61.5%), Bulgaria (61.1%) and Latvia (72%),
              only the latter exceeded 60% of female representation for the
              first time. Women&#8217;s representation among senior-level civil
              servants is the lowest, below 20%, in Belgium (17.2%) and
              Luxembourg (16.1%).

              Chief statisticians are high-ranking administrators in charge of
              national statistical offices, which are responsible for producing
              official statistics in countries worldwide. As at 2 June 2020, 24%
              of national statistical offices (52 out of 215) had a woman as
              chief statistician, very close to the proportion observed five
              years ago. As at 2020, in countries in Eastern and South-Eastern
              Asia, 39% of national statistical offices were headed by a female
              chief statistician (see figure II).
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past five years, there has been significant progress in
              Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand): in June 2020,
              national statistical offices in 7 out of 19 countries or areas in
              the region were headed by a woman, while in 2015 there were
              none.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> In contrast, there were
              no female chief statisticians of national statistical offices in
              Australia and New Zealand.

              The goal of achieving gender parity at all levels among the staff
              of the United Nations is a commitment that is now two decades old.
              During this time, significant progress has been made towards
              advancing the representation of women in the organizations and
              agencies of the United Nations system. As at 31 December 2018, the
              latest available data from across all entities of the common
              system showed that, among senior professionals and managers, women
              occupied 44% (out of 109,589 total staff) of the total number of
              appointments for a period of one year or more, an improvement
              compared to 32% of appointments (out of 15,192 total staff) in
              1997.
            </p>
            <p>
              The achievement of the goal of gender parity has remained slow and
              uneven however. The representation of women continues to be higher
              at the junior professional levels<span class="footnote-index"
                >3</span
              >
              (above 50%) and declines at higher senior professional and
              management levels<span class="footnote-index">4</span> (between
              30% and 40%). The most significant progress has been achieved at
              the highest levels of decision-making and responsibility,<span
                class="footnote-index"
                >5</span
              >
              with a 40% representation of women &ndash; a direct result of the
              commitment of the Secretary-General to reach parity at the highest
              levels by 2021. At the very top of the hierarchy, however, no
              woman has been appointed Secretary-General since the establishment
              of the United Nations in 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of December 2018, 34.6% of heads and 48% of deputy heads of
              United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were
              women, a record number. In addition, in 2018, the
              Secretary-General appointed the first female Under
              Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and
              three female special envoys.<span class="footnote-index">6</span>
              Nevertheless, despite these appointments, the proportion of female
              staff in Field Services, who are generally recruited
              internationally to serve in a civilian capacity at field missions,
              was significantly lower (27%). Furthermore, in 2019, out of
              approximately 95,000 peacekeepers, women comprised only 4.7% of
              military personnel and 10.8% of police personnel at United Nations
              peacekeeping missions.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
