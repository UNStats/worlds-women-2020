<li>As of 2020, 173 United Nations Member States and territories (93%) have ratified ILO Convention No. 100 on equal remuneration for women and men workers, and 175 Member States and territories (94%) have ratified ILO Convention No. 111 against discrimination in the field of employment and occupation.</li>
<li>A number of least developed countries, small island developing States and territories and the United States of America have not ratified ILO Convention No. 100 and/or ILO Convention No. 111.</li>
<li>National laws and regulations may not adequately protect women from discrimination in employment nor guarantee equal remuneration for women and men. As of 2020, in 33 out of 188 (18%) countries and territories with available data, laws do not &#8220;prohibit discrimination in employment based on gender&#8221; nor &#8220;mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value&#8221;.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> In 26 out of those 33 countries and territories discriminatory laws exist, despite their having ratified ILO Convention No. 100 and/or ILO Convention No. 111.</li>

</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Over 60 years ago, the International Labour Conference adopted two international conventions aimed at promoting gender equality in employment, ILO Convention No. 100, in 1951, and ILO Convention No. 111, in 1958. By ratifying ILO Convention No. 100, countries declare their commitment to gender equality in the workplace and to the adoption of national policies that ensure &#8220;the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value&#8221;,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> including addressing the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/733303cb424641cf9f3ae89ea97874d2#NW21" target="_blank">gender pay gap</a> and eliminating biases determining the value of women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s work. By ratifying ILO Convention No. 111, countries declare their determination to ensure &#8220;equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation&#8221;<span class="footnote-index">3</span> through the elimination of any direct or indirect discrimination, including on the basis of sex.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>A number of least developed countries, small island developing States and territories and the United States of America have ratified neither ILO Convention No. 100 nor ILO Convention No. 111</h4><div class="content"><p>Globally, as of 2020, 173 Member States and territories (93%) have ratified ILO Convention No. 100 and 175 Member States and territories (94%) have ratified ILO Convention No. 111 against discrimination in the field of employment and occupation.</p>
<p>A total of 14 Member States and territories have not ratified ILO Convention No. 100, including four least developed countries (Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia and Tuvalu), five small island developing States and territories (the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Tonga and Tuvalu)<span class="footnote-index">4</span> and one developed country (the United States of America). Four of those 14 Member States are in <span class="label-ref">Western Asia and Northern Africa</span> and five are in <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand).</p>
<p>A total of 12 Member States and territories have not ratified ILO Convention No. 111, including two least developed countries (Myanmar and Tuvalu), five small island developing States and territories (the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Tonga and Tuvalu) and two developed countries (Japan and the United States). Five of those 12 Member States are in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and five in <span class="label-ref">Eastern and South-Eastern Asia</span> (see table).</p>

As of 2020, in 33 out of 188 (18%) countries and territories with available data, laws neither &#8220;prohibit discrimination in employment based on gender&#8221; nor &#8220;mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value&#8221;,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> despite the fact that 26 of those countries and territories have ratified ILO Convention No. 100 and/or ILO Convention No. 111. Among these 33 countries and territories with discriminatory laws, Brunei Darussalam, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau and Tonga have ratified neither ILO Convention No. 100 nor ILO Convention No. 111.</p>
<p>Even when protective legislation exists, this does not always mean that women and men enjoy <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/4b31b21a4ccb41558b6f140a2327d225#NW11" target="_blank">equal rights</a> to/at work. <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/247cc2188f2146beacad35ef94ccf7fa#NW8" target="_blank">Discriminatory attitudes</a> on the part of both women and men towards women&#8217;s employment may also contribute to unfair treatment of women and impede gender equality in employment.</p>
