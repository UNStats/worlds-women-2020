</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Women&#8217;s access to local government positions is a right and a necessary condition for ensuring the inclusion of women&#8217;s interests and perspectives in local decision-making</strong></p>
<p>Women&#8217;s rights to political participation on equal terms with men and to shared power between women and men in decision-making bodies at all levels of government have been recognized in international normative frameworks<span class="footnote-index">1</span> and emphasized in the Beijing Platform for Action.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
<p>While the majority of research and global data collection on women&#8217;s representation in decision-making positions has been focused on national parliaments, the inclusion of women in local governments positions in the SDG monitoring framework acknowledges the importance of a whole-of-government approach to sustainable development and of women&#8217;s voices and leadership at the local as well as the national levels of government.</p>
<p>Women in local government decision-making positions represent a much more numerous and diverse group, and research shows that they redefine local priorities by being more inclusive,<span class="footnote-index">3</span> prioritizing family-friendly policies<span class="footnote-index">4</span> and, in some contexts, contributing to increased gender equality in terms of policymaking on income, employment and parental leave.<span class="footnote-index">5</span></p>
</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Women&#8217;s representation in local deliberative bodies is higher than in national parliaments, but still not on equal terms with men</strong></p>
<p>As at 1 January 2020, as shown in the data available for 133 countries and areas worldwide, women held 36% of elected seats in local deliberative bodies. While women&#8217;s representation at the local level was higher than in <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/abc5dcf8f01342adbc9578b4677e4832#ND6" target="_blank">national parliaments</a> (25%),<span class="footnote-index">6</span> it was not yet close to parity.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s representation in local deliberative bodies was at 40% or above in only a minority of countries (15%). In the majority of countries (53%), levels of women&#8217;s representation were reported at levels between 10% and 30%, and in 12% of countries women&#8217;s representation was less than 10%, a distribution similar to that observed for women&#8217;s representation in national parliaments (see figure I).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_243.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Women&#8217;s representation in local deliberative bodies varies widely across and within regions</strong></p>
<p>Women&#8217;s representation is highest in countries in the <span class="label-ref">Central and Southern Asia</span> (41%) and <span class="label-ref">Europe and Northern America</span> (35%) regions, driven, in particular, by high levels of women&#8217;s representation in countries with large numbers of councillors, such as <span class="label-ref">France</span> and <span class="label-ref">India</span>, while lowest in countries in the <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span> (18%) region (see figure II).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are countries with gender-balanced local deliberative bodies in almost all regions. Women&#8217;s representation is over 40%, for example, in: Antigua and Barbuda (67%) and Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (50%) in Latin America and the Caribbean; Belarus (48%) and Iceland (47%) in Europe; Uganda (46%) in Africa; New Caledonia (46%) in Oceania; and India (44%) in Central and Southern Asia.</p>

<p>The use of legislated gender quotas has increased women&#8217;s representation in local governments, particularly in developing regions. Legislated gender quotas are temporary special measures provided for in national legal frameworks for the purpose of correcting historical trends in numerical gender imbalance and fast tracking the increased representation of women.</p>
<p>Worldwide, countries with legislated quotas have higher levels of women&#8217;s representation in local government (by 7% on average) compared to those without quotas.<span class="footnote-index">7</span> Increases resulting from the adoption of quotas are higher in countries in developing regions (11%), particularly in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (16%) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (13%).</p>

<h1>About the data</h1>
<h2>Coverage</h2>
<p>The indicator uses official data on elections results produced by national electoral management bodies and reported to the United Nations Entity on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) by national statistical offices. As at 1 January 2020, data were available for 133 countries and areas, including three quarters of all countries with elected local deliberative bodies.<span class="footnote-index">8</span></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul class="definitions">
<li><span class="definition">Proportion of women in local government</span> is measured as the percentage of elected seats held by women in deliberative bodies of local governments (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, indicator 5.5.1(b))<span class="footnote-index">9</span>.The indicator complements SDG indicator 5.5.1(a) on women&#8217;s representation in national legislative bodies (specifically in the single or lower chambers of parliaments) by focusing on women&#8217;s representation among the millions of members of local deliberative bodies with decision-making power around the world.&#8211;</li>
<li>Local government represents a decentralization of legislative, executive and administrative powers from the national to local levels, which enables improved governance on local matters and the more direct and inclusive participation of different groups of the population in local decision-making.</li>
