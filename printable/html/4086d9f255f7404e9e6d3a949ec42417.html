<li>Globally, the incidence of HIV infection has declined by almost 50% since 2005, for both women and men.</li>
<li>Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV, with a much higher incidence rate than the world average (4 times higher for men and 5 times higher for women), as well as the region where women are at higher risk of contracting HIV (58% of all new adult HIV infections), particularly young women, who run twice the risk of infection as young men.</li>
<li>Globally, in 2017 men were less likely than women to take an HIV test (75% men versus 85% women), access antiretroviral therapy (55% men versus 68% women) or have supressed their viral loads (47% men versus 59% women).</li>
<li>Of an estimated 10 million cases of TB in 2018, 63% were among men and 37% among women.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>In developing countries, further gains in life expectancy are impeded by causes that are preventable or treatable through access to basic health services; in addition, economic, social and environmental determinants have impacts on health and wellbeing. While deaths from communicable diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and TB are usually higher in developing countries, this situation changed drastically over the course of 2020 due to the emergence of the Coronavirus-19 (<a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/2546f9aed54c4f1d8d07e65f99a55365#NH12" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>) pandemic, a highly communicable disease that has affected developing and developed countries alike.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most heavily affected by HIV and in 2018, 58% of all new adult HIV infections were among women</strong></p>
<p>Globally, in 2018 there were an estimated 1.7 million new HIV infections, an incidence rate of 0.24 per 1,000 uninfected population among the total population, with a similar incidence among women and men. The rate represents a decline of almost 50% from the infection level of 0.47 recorded in 2005.</p>
<p>There are significant regional differences in HIV transmission. <span class="label-ref">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> is the most heavily affected region in the world, with an HIV incidence of 0.93 per 1,000 for men (almost 4 times the global average) and 1.3 per 1,000 for women (more than 5 times the global average). In addition, 58% of the all new adult HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa were among women, and new infections among women aged 15&#8212;49 in sub-Saharan Africa contributed a third of total HIV infections globally.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand), the second most affected region, had an infection rate much closer to the global average, about 0.27 per 1,000 infections for women and 0.22 per 1,000 for men, with women accounting for more than half of new HIV infections (55%).</p>
<p>Countries in other parts of the world had lower rates of HIV infection, although national or regional data usually hide inequalities within, and the incidence was higher among men than women, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Europe and Northern America (at least 2.5 times higher) (see figure I), where HIV is predominantly transmitted through sex between men or intravenous drug use.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> Men who have sex with men accounted for an estimated 17% of new HIV infections globally, accounting for more than half of new HIV infections in western and central Europe and Northern America and 40% of infections in Latin America.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>
<p><a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/f13f7dc3b9744d5489e7ae3e87c57d71#NP21" target="_blank">Early marriage</a>, gender-based violence, unequal access to information, including <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/16fd3d35d4124b5891509f9970597e8b#NE18" target="_blank">sexual health knowledge</a>, and a lack of negotiating power and economic autonomy are among a number of factors that put women and adolescent girls at increased risk of HIV infection and restrict their ability to protect themselves from infection. Research has also show greater biological susceptibility to HIV infection in women, especially adolescent girls.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Among the community of men and boys who have sex with members of the same sex, masculine norms that stigmatize homosexuality can lead to promiscuity and substance abuse, increasing the risk of infection.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> More broadly, traditional masculine norms also typically equate risk-taking, aggression and stoicism with so-called manliness, and they stigmatize illness and prudence,<span class="footnote-index">6</span> which leads men to increased practice of unsafe sex, and decreased access to health services and adherence to treatment.</p>
<p>Progress in reducing rates of infection has been achieved in eastern and southern Africa, home to 54% of the global population living with HIV. During the period 2010&#8212;2018, AIDS-related mortality in these subregions declined by 44% and annual new HIV infections declined by 28%.</p>
<p>However, other regions have experienced an increase in HIV infection. Over the period 2010&#8212;2018, AIDS-related deaths in eastern Europe and central Asia increased by 5% and in Middle East and North Africa by 9%, and in three subregions the rate of HIV infection increased over the same time period: eastern Europe and central Asia (29% increase), the Middle East and North Africa (10% increase) and Latin America (7% increase).<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Globally, although new HIV infections among young women (aged 15&amp;#8212;24) fell by 25% between 2010 and 2018, rates are significantly high in some regions</h4><div class="content"><p>As reported in 2018, an alarming 7 in 10 young women in sub-Saharan Africa did not have comprehensive knowledge about HIV,<span class="footnote-index">8</span> and women overall were at higher risk of contracting HIV. Infection rates in <span class="label-ref">young women</span> aged 15&ndash;24 were almost 2.5 times as high as those of men of the same age (see figure I). A similar pattern has been reported in Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zealand, where adolescent girls and young women are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk of HIV infection.<span class="footnote-index">9</span> The pattern of high infection rates in young women reflects harmful gender norms that create unequal power dynamics in the home and wider society and deny young women control over their lives.<span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>
<p>Curbing HIV infections of girls and adolescents is particularly important in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, since about 90% of HIV infections in infants and children are passed on from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding, and half of all infants infected with HIV are likely to die before their second birthday if they do not receive treatment.<span class="footnote-index">11</span> Persistent efforts to reach pregnant women living with HIV have resulted in a 44% decline in incidence among young children between 2010 and 2018 globally.<span class="footnote-index">12</span></p>
<p>Condom promotion remains a mainstay of prevention. However, according to UNAIDS,<span class="footnote-index">13</span> from a sample of 12 countries in West and Central Africa with recent data,<span class="footnote-index">14</span> more than half of young men (aged 15&ndash;24 years) in only 6 countries reported condom use at last incidence of high-risk sex. These data also show that condom use among young women was consistently lower.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_105.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Globally, in 2017, men were less likely than women to take an HIV test, access antiretroviral therapy or have suppressed their viral loads.<span class="footnote-index">15</span></strong></p>
<p>The uptake of testing and treatment can be low if such services are difficult to access. Fear of stigma and discrimination can also result in delays in seeking care, which can result in poor health outcomes.<span class="footnote-index">16</span> <span class="footnote-index"> 17</span> <span class="footnote-index">18</span> Men have reduced access to health-care services compared with women, who often access HIV services through maternal health services. Moreover, in general, men are less likely to seek health care,<span class="footnote-index">19</span> <span class="footnote-index">20</span> and are thus less likely to be diagnosed (75% men living with HIV/AIDS know their status versus 84% of women) and treated (55% among diagnosed men receive antiretroviral therapy versus 68% women) (see figure II). When men living with HIV are not diagnosed, do not start HIV treatment or fail to continue treatment, both their own health and the well-being and prospects of their partners, households, extended families and communities are jeopardized.</p>
<p>The intersections between infectious diseases, including HIV, and structural inequalities cannot be overstated.<span class="footnote-index">21</span> In light of the <span class="label-ref">COVID-19</span> pandemic, efforts must be made to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services and supplies in sub-Saharan Africa. Models show that if no action is taken, a six-month complete disruption in HIV services, including antiretroviral therapy, could lead to more than 500,000 additional deaths in the period 2020&ndash;2021 in sub-Saharan Africa from AIDS-related illnesses, including TB.<span class="footnote-index">22</span></p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_106.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>People who are infected with HIV are 19 times more likely to develop active TB<span class="footnote-index">23</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2018, it is estimated that there were 10 million cases of TB, 63% among men and 37% among women. While the incidence of TB appears to increase as men grow older, it remains relatively constant across age for women. Regional differences, with incidence among women consistently lower than men, were also significant (see figure III). Incidence was highest in <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand), with 6.5 new notified cases per 100,000 for men and 2.4 per 100,000 for women, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia. Regional gender gaps in the incidence of TB also varied significantly, with the largest gender gap reported in Northern America and Europe, where men are 2.2 times more likely than women to be infected by TB, followed by Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, where men are almost twice as likely to be infected by TB as women.</p>
<p>The higher estimated incidence among men may be partly explained by men being more likely to smoke or drink.<span class="footnote-index">24</span> <span class="footnote-index">25</span> As reported by WHO, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Central and Southern Asia are the top three regions in terms of prevalence of <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/022ab89e10d04700901ced2a133eda86#NH6" target="_blank">tobacco smoking</a> among men. The prevalence of smoking in adult men (aged over 15) is above 40% in 10 of the 30 countries with high incidence of TB.<span class="footnote-index">26</span> Immunological reasons for an excess of TB infection in men have also been proposed.<span class="footnote-index">27</span></p>
<p>Male TB patients appear to be less likely to seek care than female TB patients, as reflected in lower rates of case notification compared with the estimated total of cases (see figure III). As a consequence, male patients remain infectious in the community longer than female patients. There is a need for strategies to improve access to and use of health-care services among men, not only to address gender inequities but also to reduce infection to greatest extent possible. Potential strategies include the more active targeting of men with routine diagnostic and screening services.</p>
<p>Even though globally men are significantly more at risk of contracting and dying from TB than women, TB can have particularly severe consequences for women, especially during their reproductive years and during pregnancy. TB among mothers is associated with a six-fold increase in perinatal deaths and a two-fold risk of premature birth and low birth-weight; TB in pregnant women living with HIV increases the risk of maternal and infant mortality by almost 400%.<span class="footnote-index">28</span></p>
<p>Modelling suggests that if the <span class="label-ref">COVID-19</span> pandemic leads to a 25% global reduction in expected TB detection for three months, a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption being observed in multiple countries, a 13% rise in TB deaths might be expected. This would mean that global mortality rates from TB infection could return to those seen five years ago.<span class="footnote-index">29</span></p>
