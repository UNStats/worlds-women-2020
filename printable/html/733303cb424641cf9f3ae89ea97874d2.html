</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Gender pay gap is a global measure to assess progress in reducing the differences in average earnings of women and men, and it may result from a multitude of explained and unexplained factors. The explained factors combine: (a) the individual characteristics of women and men in the labour market; (b) the types of jobs they perform; and (c) the types of establishments or companies in which they work, and includes age, level and field of education, work experience, <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/92b9b878ae304c388d10a3c31facb87f#NW3" target="_blank">occupation</a>, <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/16cf3ba269944620b610ef7f80671fd3#NW2" target="_blank">economic sector</a>, type of contract and working time of employed women and men, as well as the age, size, legal status and private/foreign/state ownership of the establishments in which they work. Gender inequalities in most of these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes (influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men) as well as difficulties in balancing work and family life, which often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly among women.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

In most countries, women earned less than men, and the median gender pay gap for these 58 countries was 12% in favour of men. However, a gender pay gap in favour of women was found in Latin America and the Caribbean, where statistics on earnings were produced from a variety of data sources with discrepancies in coverage, scope and characteristics. In that region, in more than half the countries with available data for the period 2014&#8212;2018, men earned less than women. Among 33 countries in Europe with more comparable data on the gender pay gap during the same time period, women were generally paid less than men, with a gender pay gap in the region ranging between 2% and 28%. Six countries, namely, Austria, Estonia, Germany, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, had the largest gender pay gaps in the region, amounting to more than 20%. Average hourly earnings of employed women and men differed the most in countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, although data were available for only five countries: the gender pay gap was calculated as 22% in favour of women in Thailand (with women earning more) and 31% in favour of men in the Republic of Korea (with men earning more) (see figure I).</p>

During the same period, 18 out of the 27 (67%) countries showed a decrease in the pay gap, with the largest decline in pay differences in Europe between women and men provisionally recorded in Estonia, where women were paid 28.2% less than men in 2014 and 22.7% less in 2018<span class="footnote-index">3</span> (see figure II).</p>

<p>As called for by the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted in 1995, women and men have the right to equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. However, even when a large number of explained factors are taken into consideration, pay differentials between women and men can be explained only to a certain extent. Those that cannot be explained may be attributed to omitted variables and other factors not covered by available data, including gender discrimination.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>

<p>With the aim of promoting equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, several countries in developed regions, including Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, have introduced legal or regulatory obligations for enterprises of varying sizes to publish sex-disaggregated data on wages.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

<p>Following the enforcement of the revised Gender Equality Act in 2020, companies in Switzerland with 100 or more employees are required to conduct an equal pay analysis by 2021. A free-of-charge web application standard analysis tool named <a href="https://www.ebg.admin.ch/ebg/en/home/services/logib.html" target="_blank">Logib</a> has been developed to enable companies with 50 or more employees to carry out standardized and reliable pay equality analysis with a minimal administrative burden. It is estimated that Logib will be used by thousands of companies both in Switzerland and abroad.<span class="footnote-index">8</span> Once anonymous data on employees&#8217; individual characteristics, workplace characteristics, working hours and payments are fed into the application, information on average payments to women and to men, as well as on the number of women in different wage quartiles, are produced in a simple manner, assisting the identification of possible gender pay gaps at the enterprise level.</p>

<p>Statistics on earnings are obtained from various data sources. Most countries in developing regions rely on labour force surveys or household income and expenditure surveys, while most countries in developed regions rely on establishment surveys. Cross-country comparisons of earnings data from different data sources are affected by type and age of workers covered, as well as by the exclusion of certain economic sectors. International comparability is hampered by differences across countries in the size criterion adopted in surveys or censuses. In addition, the average earnings of particular groups, including women, are affected by the different elements that make up the groups and their characteristics. Furthermore, earnings reflected in SDG indicator 8.5.1 may omit earnings of part-time workers and/or of domestic workers, depending on the data source. This is particularly relevant given that women are more likely to hold part-time jobs and to work as domestic workers than men and that both part-time and domestic workers generally have lower hourly earnings. </p>
