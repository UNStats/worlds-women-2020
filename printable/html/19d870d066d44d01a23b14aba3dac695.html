<li>The five-fold increase in the rate of marriage of girls younger than age 15 observed during the period 2012&#8212;2017 resulted from a number of factors, including poverty and population growth owing to the influx of foreigners into the country as a result of armed conflicts in neighbouring countries.</li>

</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p><a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/f13f7dc3b9744d5489e7ae3e87c57d71#NP21" target="_blank">Child marriage</a> is a form of violence against girls, which deprives them of their legitimate human rights, including their right to education, to make an informed choice of a life partner and to build positive family relationships. Lack of such rights has a negative effect on the quality of girls' lives, their reproductive health and their ability to find decent work.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>After years of significant and steady decrease, child marriage spiked in 2017 </strong></p>
<p>Analysis of data from the Population and Family and Health Survey in Jordan shows that there was a significant and steady decrease in the percentage of women married before age 15 and before age 18 during the period 1997&#8212;2012 (see figure I):<span class="footnote-index">1</span> child marriage before age 18 decreased from 13.5% to 8.4% while marriage before age 15 decreased from around 1% to almost zero (0.3%). That decrease was due to amendments made to the Provisional Personal Status Law No. 82 in 2001 to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18.</p>
<p>However, early marriage among women aged 20&#8212;24, particularly those who married before age 15, increased significantly in recent years (a five-fold increase between 2012 and 2017), from almost zero to 1.5%. During the same period, the proportion of women aged 20&#8212;24 who married before age 18 registered a moderate increase, from 8.4% to 9.7%. The increase in child marriage in Jordan between 2012 and 2017 resulted from a number of factors, including poverty and population growth owing to the influx of foreigners into Jordan as a result of armed conflicts in neighbouring countries.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_39.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Legislative amendments at the national level have resulted in a significant drop in early marriage</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the legal age of marriage in Jordan is 18 for both women and men, it may be lowered for girls aged 15 and over at the discretion of the chief justice. By 2017 (see figure I), child marriage was on the rise, threatening the core of the institution of marriage and destroying the life and dreams of children. According to the 2017 annual statistical report by the Supreme Judge Department, Jordanian authorities issued 77,700 marriage contracts in 2017, 13.4% of which involved girls under age 18. As a coordinated response, the Government of Jordan, through legislative amendments, has placed a high priority on the elimination of child marriage in the country. The amendments introduced a number of new provisions, including: a maximum 15-year difference in ages between husband and wife; the restriction that the husband must have no other wives; and that marriage must not prevent girls from continuing their education. As a result of the new regulations, child marriage contracts dropped significantly in 2018, by 27% compared to 2017 (see figure II).</p>
