          <div class="content">
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li>
                In 2019, one country in the European Union had surpassed the
                target of 40% of women on corporate boards recommended by the
                European Commission, and four other countries in the European
                Union came close, with shares above 35%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Government intervention has proven to be an effective method for
                improving gender diversity on corporate boards. Since the
                European Commission recommended the adoption of legislative
                action to set a gender target for board membership in 2010, the
                average proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed
                companies in the European Union has doubled (from 11.9% in 2010
                to 28.8% in 2019).
              </li>
              <li>
                In those countries in the European Union with legislative
                quotas, women&#8217;s representation on boards increased by 20
                percentage points more than in countries without quotas or
                related actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overall, female representation on corporate boards has been
                growing, particularly in developed countries, although not fast
                enough: at the current pace, the goal of 30% of women&#8217;s
                representation on boards will not be reached until 2029.
              </li>
              <li>
                The representation of women on corporate boards varies across
                economic sectors. In 2019, the financial sector had the highest
                proportion of companies with at least three women on their
                boards (45%) while the industrial sector had the largest
                proportion of companies without female representation at the
                board level (25%), as was also the case in the information
                technology (22%) and communications services sectors (22%).
              </li>
              <li>
                The &#8220;glass wall&#8221; phenomenon, which keeps women in
                support management positions rather than allowing them access to
                strategic management functions, still exists at the board level.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the share of female participation in the boardroom has
                increased, boards remain largely chaired by men, and in 2018 the
                share of female board chairs was less than 10% in almost all
                regions. Even in Europe, where the majority of legislative
                quotas on female board membership have been implemented, only
                6.9% of board chairs are women.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data from 2018 show that, across regions, companies with female
                rather than male board chairs have a significantly higher number
                of women on their boards. The same phenomenon was found to apply
                at companies with a female Chief Executive Officer.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Globally, an increasing number of companies are using 30% as the
              gender balance target on corporate boards, following initiatives
              such as the &#8220;30% Club&#8221;, a campaign promoting greater
              female representation on corporate boards launched in the United
              Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2010.<span

                >1</span
              >
              Furthermore, in 2010, the European Commission suggested
              legislative action to set a gender target on boards, proposing a
              target of 40% of women&#8217;s representation on corporate boards
              in 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, the highest percentage of female board members in the
              largest publicly listed companies in the
              <span class="label-ref">European Union</span> was found in France
              (45.3%), the only country reaching the 40% target suggested by the
              European Commission. Four other countries exceeded 35%, Sweden
              (37.5%), Italy (36.1%), Belgium (35.9%) and Germany (35.6%), with
              the latter three also surpassing their legislative quota targets.
              Overall, a total of 11 countries out of the 28 countries in the
              European Union (39%) had over 30% of women as board members of
              their largest publicly listed companies. Nevertheless, in 12
              countries, women constituted less than a fifth of board members,
              and in 3 countries they represented less than 10% of board
              members: Cyprus (9.1%), Estonia (9.4%) and Malta (10%) (see figure
              I).

              Government intervention has proven to be an effective method for
              improving gender diversity on corporate boards. Before 2010, the
              proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies
              in the countries of the
              <span class="label-ref">European Union</span> was steady. In 2010,
              the European Commission recommended the adoption of legislative
              action to set a gender target on boards. Since 2010, the average
              proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies
              has doubled, from 11.9% in 2010, to 28.8% in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of the 11 countries with over 30% of female board members, five
              had implemented legislative quotas. The proportion of women on
              boards has gone up by 25.8% in the five countries with legislative
              quotas compared to a 16.9% overall increase in the 28 countries of
              the European Union. This difference is striking when compared to
              countries without quotas or that have taken no action at all,
              where there was only a 4.1% increase in women&#8217;s
              representation over the same nine-year period. Less dramatic
              improvements have been observed in countries using soft measures,
              or non-binding quotas, where women&#8217;s representation on
              boards increased by 13.2% over the same time period (see figure
              II).

              In 2019, the distribution of companies by number of women on their

              support management positions rather than strategic management

              particularly apparent in companies with a two-tier board
              structure. Some countries have a mandatory two-tier structure: a
              management board and a supervisory board. The executive directors
              on the management board decide about the company&#8217;s

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              While the share of female participation on corporate boards has
              increased, boards in all the regions remain largely chaired by
              men. As noted in the above-mentioned ILO report, in 2018, over 76%
              of companies reported having a man as the chair of the board
              (among surveyed companies that have a board), and, when further
              investigating the presence of women as board chairs of large
              listed companies in selected countries, the report noted that the
              share is generally less than 10%. Data compiled by the Deloitte
              Global Center for Corporate Governance in 2018, covering nearly
              7,000 companies in 66 countries, show that the proportion of
              female board chairs is less than 10% in almost all regions. Even
              in <span class="label-ref">Europe</span>, where the majority of
              legislative quotas on female board members have been implemented,
              only 6.9% of board chairs are women (see figure V).<span

              Data from 2018 show that, across regions, companies with female
              rather than male board chairs have a significantly higher number
              of women serving on boards. For example, in Asia, the percentage
              of women on boards was 19.2% when the chair was a woman compared
              to 9.9% when the chair was a man. The same phenomenon was found in
              companies with a female Chief Executive Officer. The largest
