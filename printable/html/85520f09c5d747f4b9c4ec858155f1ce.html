<li>As of 2020, 38 States Members of the United Nations had ratified the Maternity Protection Convention (Convention No. 183) adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2000.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></li>
<li>In 2020, of the 185 countries and territories with available data, 53% offer at least 14 weeks of maternity leave, an increase from 38% in 1994.</li>
<li>As of 2020, 77% of the 185 countries and territories with available data had granted two thirds of women&#8217;s previous earnings as maternity leave benefits.</li>
<li>Of the 188 countries and territories with available data reviewed by the World Bank in 2020, 103 countries (55%) have provisions for paternity leave, an increase over the 30 countries (16%) that offered such leave in 1995. As reported by the World Bank, globally, the median length of paid paternity leave is five days, a low number when compared with the 56 days of paternity leave granted in some high-income States members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</li>

</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>Maternity protection, which is a fundamental human right and a critical element of policies balancing the participation of women and men in family and work life, covers, inter alia: the prevention of exposure to health and safety hazards during and after pregnancy; entitlement to paid maternity leave and breastfeeding breaks; maternal and child health care; protection against discrimination in employment and occupations, including with respect to recruitment and dismissal; and the guaranteed right to return to the same position or an equivalent position after maternity leave.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
<p>Maternity protection not only contributes to the health and well-being of mothers and their children, it also promotes gender equality in the workplace. Three conventions on maternity protection have been adopted by ILO, in 1919, 1952 and 2000: the most recent, the Maternity Protection Convention (Convention No. 183), stipulates that women should be entitled to no less than 14 weeks of maternity leave, with paid cash benefits amounting to at least two thirds of their normal earnings.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>

<p>As of 2020, 38 States Members of the United Nations in regions throughout the world had ratified the Maternity Leave Convention (Convention No. 183), 24 of them in developed regions: more than half (53%) of the 185 countries with available data offer 14 weeks minimum statutory maternity leave, specifying such leave in national laws and regulations, as recommended in Convention No. 183.</p>
<p>As of 2020, Australia and New Zealand and all countries in <span class="label-ref">Central Asia</span> offer at least 14 weeks of maternity leave. Almost all countries in <span class="label-ref">developed regions</span> have also followed the recommendation in Convention No. 183, with the exception of Iceland (13 weeks) and the United States of America (12 weeks). Entitlement to maternity leave has been increased up to 52 weeks in five countries in Europe,<span class="footnote-index">4</span> and up to 59 weeks in Croatia, since the adoption of the Maternity Protection Convention in 2000. It should be noted that in these countries, women&#8217;s labour force participation has grown in recent years, contrary to the global trend. In contrast, less than a quarter of countries with available data in Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), South-Eastern Asia (20%), <span class="label-ref">Southern Asia</span> (14%) and <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0%) offer 14 weeks or more of maternity leave (see figure I). Globally, the proportion of countries with available data offering a minimum of 14 weeks of maternity leave increased from 38% to 53% during the period from 1994 to 2020.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_167.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>Four out of five countries grant at least two thirds of women&amp;#8217;s previous earnings as maternity leave payments as recommended by ILO Convention No. 183 </h4><div class="content"><p>According to ILO Convention No. 183, women should be granted paid cash benefits of at least two thirds of their previous earnings during maternity leave. In 2020, out of 185 countries with available information on maternity leave, 143 (77%) meet this criterion, including all countries in Eastern Asia and Southern Asia.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> The proportion that meet the criterion is slightly lower in Western Asia (94%), South-Eastern Asia (80%), Latin America and the Caribbean (79%), sub-Saharan Africa (76%) and Northern America and Europe (74%). Some countries have other pay schemes with conditional benefits constituting a higher or a lower proportion of maternity leave payments than two thirds of women&#8217;s previous income (see figure II).</p>
<p>Three countries, <span class="label-ref">Lesotho</span>, <span class="label-ref">Papua New Guinea</span> and the <span class="label-ref">United States</span> (except the State of California), did not have legal provisions to provide cash benefits for women on maternity leave. In <span class="label-ref">Tunisia</span>, cash benefits during maternity leave for employed women varied based on institutional and <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/16cf3ba269944620b610ef7f80671fd3#NW2" target="_blank">economic sectors</a>: while women employed in the agriculture sector received 50% of their flat-rate daily wage during maternity leave, payments amounted to the full salary for women working as civil servants.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_168.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>Paternity leave is becoming more common</h4><div class="content"><p>Many countries have adopted maternity and paternity benefits through legislation, benefitting both mothers and fathers. Paternity leave is a short period of leave for the father following the arrival of his child(ren), with the objective of encouraging fathers to assist in childcare and to attend to other family-related responsibilities. Paternity leave has become more common: in 2020, among 188 United Nations Member States and territories with available data worldwide, 103 countries (55%) had provisions on paternity leave, up from the 30 countries (16%) that provided such leave in 1995 (see figure III).</p>
<p>In 2020 in developed regions, new fathers are not entitled to paid paternity leave in Austria, Belarus, Switzerland, Israel, Montenegro, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia and Ukraine. Twenty-six countries in <span class="label-ref">sub-Saharan Africa</span> and 17 countries and territories in <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> do not mandate paid time off for new fathers. In 2020, the median length of paid paternity leave worldwide was five days, similar to the corresponding figures observed in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (3 days) and Latin America and the Caribbean (5 days), a low number when compared with the 56 days of paternity leave provided in some high income States members of OECD.<span class="footnote-index">6</span> The European Union work-life balance directive, which entered into force as of 1 August 2019, extends the length of paternity leave in EU member states to at least 10 working days.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
<p>Paternity leave also has significant positive effects on women&#8217;s <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/27c1c1ad540347aabc70434238223919#NW1" target="_blank">employment</a>, with an estimated increase of almost 7% in the proportion of women employed in private firms in developing regions when paternity leave is mandated.<span class="footnote-index">8</span></p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_169.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>Institution in focus: United Nations</h4><div class="content"><p>In 2019, the Chair of the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) communicated his commitment to reviewing parental leave entitlements to balance participation of all <span class="label-ref">United Nations</span> staff, irrespective of gender, in family and work life. If endorsed by ICSC, the proposed gender responsive and family-friendly policies, such as paid parental leave for all parents, including those who adopt, foster or have children through surrogacy or assisted reproductive technology, would set the standards of inclusive participation, respect for diversity and work-life balance called for in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to promote a gender-equal world.<span class="footnote-index">9</span> <span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>
