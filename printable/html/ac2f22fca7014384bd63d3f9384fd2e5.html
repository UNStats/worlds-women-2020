<li>In Colombia, in 2017: employed women spent 2 hours and 8 minutes more than employed men in paid and unpaid work per day; in the population aged 10 years and older, women worked 2 hours and 10 minutes more than men &#8212; this gap persists across all age groups.</li>
<li>While gender gaps in paid work for indigenous persons (1:32 hours, with women working 5:31 hours and men 7:03) and for Afro-Colombians (1:54 hours, with women working 6:54 hours and men 8:48) were similar to the gender gap in the total population (1:39 hours, with women working 7:35 hours and men 9:14), indigenous and Afro-Colombian women and men spent proportionately less time in paid work than women and men in the total population.</li>
<li>Cultural norms and traditional gender roles contribute to the sexual division of labour, with older persons and people living in rural areas tending to agree with the following statement: &#8220;The head of the home must be the man&#8221;, and with men agreeing more than women across all age groups (overall agreement: 37% of all women versus 47% of all men).</li>
<li>Engagement in unpaid work impacted participation in the labour market by Colombian women and men. In the period 2009&#8212;2019, the unemployment rate among women was higher than that among men by at least 4.9%. The unemployment rate among women never fell into a single-digit number range during this time period.</li>
<li>In Colombia, the unemployment rate among women was higher than that of men across all levels of education, although in 2019 the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5% for women with postgraduate education. Women aged 18&#8212;24 were most affected by unemployment and faced the largest gender gap.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4>There is a gender gap in time use in Colombia</h4><div class="content"><p>In 2017, the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826#NW25" target="_blank">total workload</a> of women in Colombia was 13 hours and 24 minutes per day, of which 56.5% was dedicated to paid work and 43.5% to unpaid work. The total workload of men was 11 hours and 16 minutes a day, 82% of which corresponded to paid work and 18% to unpaid work. In total, employed women worked 2 hours and 8 minutes more than employed men per day (see figure I).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_212.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Similarly, among the working population aged 10 or older, Colombian women worked about 2 hours more than men. Women received remuneration for 51.2% of their total working time, while men were paid for 73.1% of their total working time (see figure II).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_213.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Data indicate that Colombian women have less time available for personal activities, including rest and study, and less paid hours, which affects their economic empowerment, their bargaining power inside the home and their well-being. This gap persists across all age groups (see figure III), resulting in a sexual division of labour<span class="footnote-index">1</span> within households throughout the life cycle.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_214.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>This sexual division of labour was also observed by <span class="label-ref">ethnicity</span> (see figure IV). In the case of Afro-Colombians, the gender gap in unpaid work hours per day (4:17 hours, with women working 7:19 hours and men 3:12) was 11.8% (27 minutes), which was greater than the gender gap observed in the total population (3:49 hours, with women working 7:14 hours and men 3:25).</p>
<p>Gender gaps in paid work for <span class="label-ref">indigenous persons</span> (1:32 hours, with women working 5:31 hours and men 7:03) and for Afro-Colombians (1:54, with women working 6:54 hours and men 8:48) were similar to the gender gap in paid work in the total population (1:39 hours, with women working 7:35 hours and men 9:14). Nevertheless, among indigenous persons and Afro-Colombians, both men and women spent proportionately less time in paid work than men and women in the total population.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_215.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>The division of labour between women and men is enabled by cultural norms and traditional gender roles</h4><div class="content"><p>In order to measure perceptions about stereoptypical gender roles among women and men in Colombia, the national Time Use Survey: 2016&#8212;2017 included five questions containing sexist statements. Understanding the prevalence of rigid gender stereotypes in the population is crucial for the formulation of policies to promote cultural change towards the elimination of <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/247cc2188f2146beacad35ef94ccf7fa#NW8" target="_blank">harmful social norms and discriminatory attitudes</a>.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the sexual division of labour is not surprising given than 65% of the population agreed that &#8220;Women are better for domestic work than men&#8221;, and more than 35% thought that &#8220;A man's duty is to earn money; a woman's duty is to take care of the home and family&#8221;. In answers to almost all such questions in the survey, a greater proportion of men than that women agreed with the sexist statements (see table).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_216.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Furthermore, <span class="label-ref">elderly</span>&#8211;people and people residing in <span class="label-ref">rural areas</span> tended to be more in agreement with the following statement: &#8220;The head of the home must be the man.&#8221; To varying degrees, the proportion of men agreeing with that statement was higher than that of women across all age groups, but the proportion of men in agreement was above 40% in all cases (see figure V).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_217.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>Decisions about which member of the household engages in unpaid work impact the labour market participation of women and men</h4><div class="content"><p>Time is a scarce resource. During the entire period 2009&#8212;2019, the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/3cbb3176f1434be9998a51378715e290#NW26" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> among women was higher than that of men, and the gender gap was measured, at its lowest, at 4.9 percentage points during the period 2014&#8212;2016. The overall unemployment rate among women did not fall into a single-digit number range during the entire period 2009&#8212;2019 (see figure VI).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_218.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Against this backdrop, <span class="label-ref">younger women</span> and women with middle level education were more affected by unemployment compared to men. Women have a higher unemployment rate than men across all levels of education, although, in 2019, the rate dropped to 5.5% for women with postgraduate education (see figure VII).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_219.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>Women aged 18&#8212;24 were most affected by unemployment, and that age group was also the one with the most significant gender gap against women in the rate of unemployment (see figure VIII).</p>
