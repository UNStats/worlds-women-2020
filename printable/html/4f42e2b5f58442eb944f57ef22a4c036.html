</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>By the end of 2019, the world&#8217;s forcibly displaced population remained at a record high, with a total of 79.5 million individuals having been forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, violence or human rights violations, an increase of 8.7 million people over 2018. This population includes 26 million refugees, 45.7 million internally displaced people and 4.2 million asylum-seekers.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> Overall, based on available data, there appear to be approximately equal numbers of women and men among refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced persons reported to UNHCR.</p>
<p>Among the refugee population, in 2019, the lowest proportions of women were among refugees hosted in Northern America and Europe and in Eastern Asia and South-Eastern Asia, where slightly less than 40% were women. This sex imbalance was most pronounced among adults in those two regions, with only around 35% of all refugees above the age of 18 being women, while there were marginally more boys than girls under age 18 (see figure I). In contrast, the highest proportion of girls and women among refugee populations (52%) was in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 25% of all refugees hosted in sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and Western Asia, Central and Southern Asia and Latin-America and the Caribbean were girls under the age of 18.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_120.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>By the end of 2019, an estimated 45.7 million people were internally displaced due to armed conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations, as reported by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre for 61 countries and territories.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> An additional 5.1 million people were internally displaced as a result of disasters across 95 countries and territories. This is an increase over the total of 41.3 million displaced people reported at the end of 2018.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In particular, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, there were 3.3 million internally displaced girls under age 5 at the end of 2019: 5.8 million were aged 5&#8212;14; 4.8 million aged 15&#8212;24; 9.6 million aged 25&#8212;59; as well as 2 million women aged 60 and older (see figure II). Current data suggest that the proportion of women and girls among internally displaced persons is often higher than among the national population. The higher numbers of forcibly displaced women compared to men are often linked to socioeconomic factors and local conflict dynamics. In the case of armed conflict, this may be explained by the fact that men often stay behind to fight, while women tend to flee for safety along with dependent family members.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_121.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>In such circumstances, women face significantly different challenges than men in terms of livelihood needs and access to economic opportunities, including financial strains and difficulties resulting not only from displacement itself but also from gender norms, which may impose specific <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826#NW25" target="_blank">household responsibilities</a> and/or prevent them from <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/27c1c1ad540347aabc70434238223919#NW1" target="_blank">working</a>. Internal displacement also has an impact on women&#8217;s ability to find shelter and security, to access services such as education and health care and to participate in decision-making processes.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> A recent study conducted by the Government of Colombia<span class="footnote-index">6</span> revealed that conflict and forced displacement exacerbates discrimination and violence against women, leaving forcibly displaced women more exposed to <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/e4db21be88f5489db915cc75d14c8fde#NV2" target="_blank">sexual</a> and <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/50dd1b2d6167437693178836261522e6#NV1" target="_blank">domestic</a> violence and labour exploitation. It also showed that forcibly displaced women often face greater obstacles in access to education and <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/68c4420b26c04066b787f56b854b9c0b#NW12" target="_blank">land ownership</a>, as well as in making their voices heard in public and political spheres.</p>
<p>In situations of forced displacement, women&#8217;s economic activities are significant and crucial, often contributing to the livelihood of their families and communities and to the strengthening of their economic stability. However, as observed in some studies, women may also be empowered in such scenarios as there may be more space for them to participate in decision-making and in activities outside the home. Although displacement is a traumatic experience, it may also be a space for redefining and negotiating pre-existing roles, which can lead to an improvement of women&#8217;s previous circumstances and social status. A recent report assessed the impact of displacement on the gender roles and relations of women and girls who were forced to move from a rural area to a peri-urban area in Pakistan. Before displacement, livelihood opportunities had been limited for women, who were mostly able to engage in activities related to household and agricultural work. After moving, women were obliged to look for alternative sources of income, such as sewing, which allowed them to earn money and to manage their earnings independently. In addition, the perception of the importance of girls&#8217; education, which was previously regarded as superfluous, was altered owing to displacement. Other life-changing transformations were possible due to greater access to amenities such as running water, cooking gas and electricity, which reduced the amount of time women and girls dedicated to domestic chores.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
<p>However, in order to increase and maintain women&#8217;s livelihood opportunities, further transformation needs to take place within the household, the community and within institutions. This should be accompanied by the long-term and continuous development of non-economic aspects, such as women&#8217;s access to education, and the implementation of laws and policies supporting women&#8217;s empowerment. Increased availability of disaggregated data on internal displacement is also crucial to a better understanding and response to the needs of displaced women and girls, as well as to inform improved policymaking. These measures could not only enable women and girls to overcome challenges associated with displacement, but also provide them with ways to benefit from it.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Demographically disaggregated data on refugees and asylum-seekers reported to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2019 varied widely between countries and population groups. In 2019, 123 countries reported sex-disaggregated data for refugees, and 129 for asylum-seekers. For refugees and refugee-like populations, sex-disaggregated data was available for 81% of the population. The coverage of sex-disaggregated data for asylum-seekers was 42%. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reported that, in 2018, only 14% of the countries and territories for which data was collected on internally displaced persons published information disaggregated by sex and age. Statistics on forced displacement are often limited in terms of disaggregated data. Case studies are the main source of detailed information on refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons.<span class="footnote-index">16</span></p>
