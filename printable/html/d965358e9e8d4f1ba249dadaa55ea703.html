<li>Labour force participation rates in Japan have increased since 2001, particularly among women aged 15&#8212;64 (70%) and 25&#8212;44 years (76%) as of 2018.</li>
<li>During the period 1980&#8212;2018, the share of dual-income households doubled, while the share households with working men and economically inactive women declined by almost half.</li>
<li>55.3% of women in dual-income households work as non-regular employees; they constitute 68.1% of total non-regular employees as of 2019.</li>
<li>Large gender gaps are observed in the responses of women and men aged 34&#8212;54 among their reasons for choosing non-regular work, including &#8220;working at a convenient time&#8221;, &#8220;supplementing family income&#8221; and &#8220;handling housework, childcare and nursing care work.&#8221;</li>
<li>Although non-regular employment facilitates flexible working arrangements, it is one of the main factors contributing to the gender pay gap in Japan.</li>

These data represent an improvement from 2001, when the gender gap for the two age groups was 23 and 18 percentage points, respectively (see figure I).</p>

The majority of female employees aged 35&#8212;54 gave reasons including: &#8220;for working at a convenient time&#8221;, &#8220;to supplement family income&#8221; and &#8220;to handle housework, childcare and nursing care work&#8221;, with significant gender gaps among the reasons given by women and men in the same age group (see figure III).</p>
