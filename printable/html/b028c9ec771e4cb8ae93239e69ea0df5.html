<li>Women&#8217;s representation among cabinet ministers has increased almost four-fold over the last 25 years, although in 2020, on average, only one in five ministers (22%) is a woman.</li>
<li>Progress in women&#8217;s representation among regions over the past 15 years has been uneven, reaching 39% in Western Europe but only 6% to 16% in Northern Africa, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Asia.</li>
<li>While progress in selected countries since 1994 has been significant, and the number of countries with at least 30% of women among ministers increased from 5 to 51, in 2020 gender parity (around 50%) among cabinet ministers has been reached or surpassed in only 14 countries.</li>
<li>In 2020, female ministers continued to be concentrated in ministries related to family and social issues.</li>
<li>Very few women get to the top position of power within government. As of 2020, the total number of countries with a female Head of State or Government was 20, a slight improvement over the 12 countries with female Heads of State in 1995: as of 2020, most countries headed by women were in Europe.</li>

<p>Progress among regions over the past 15 years has been uneven: by 2020, the highest level of representation of women among ministers, at 39%, was reached in countries in Western Europe. The share of women among ministers remained low, at 16% or less, in <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa</span> and <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) , and only between 6% and 16% of ministers were women in Asia (all regions) (see figure I).</p>

<p>By 2020, gender parity (around 50%) among cabinet ministers has been reached or surpassed in only 14 countries however: Spain (66.7%), Finland(61.1%), Nicaragua (58.8%), Colombia (57.9%), Austria (57.1%), Peru (55.0%), Sweden (54.5%), Rwanda (53.6%), Albania (53.3%), France (52.9%), Andorra (50%), Costa Rica (50%), Canada (50%) and Guinea-Bissau (50%) (closely followed by South Africa (48.3%), Ethiopia (47.6%) and El Salvador (47.1%)).</p>
<p>Looking at recent progress, the largest increase in the proportion of women among ministers was in Ethiopia, where the share of women in top positions rose from 10% in 2017 to 47.6% in 2020. At the other end of the spectrum, the greatest decrease in the share of female ministers took place in Slovenia during the same time period, where the proportion fell from 50% to 23.5%.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>In 2020, portfolios held by female ministers continued to be those related to family and social issues</h4><div class="content"><p>In general, women continue to be assigned to portfolios related to social issues, including those related to thefamily, children, youth, older persons and persons with disabilitiesandsocial affairs.Portfolios related to theenvironment, national resources and energy,employment and labour and vocational trainingare among the top four ministries led by women.Women&#8217;s affairs, which includes the gender-equalityportfolio, occupy the fifth position. In 2020, fewer female ministers held portfolios related totransport;population;information and the media; andparliamentary affairs(see figure II).</p>
<p>More detailed data available for selected countries<span class="footnote-index">5</span> show that, in 2017, the only countries with a 50% representation of women among core ministers of State<span class="footnote-index">6</span> were Canada, Norway and Slovenia; women occupy 40% of cabinet positions in Iceland and Sweden.</p>

However, very few women get to the top position of power within their government.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As of 1 January 2020, only 10 out of 152 elected Heads of State worldwide were women, and only 12 of 193 Governments were headed by women (see table).
