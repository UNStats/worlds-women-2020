<li>In 2016, at the global level, maternal conditions were the leading cause of death among young women (aged 15&#8212;29); for young men in the same age bracket road injuries were the leading cause of death.</li>
<li>
<p>The leading causes of death among women aged 15-49, both at the global level and in sub-Saharan Africa, are HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions. Within the same age group, men&#8217;s causes of death are globally dominated by road injuries and ischaemic heart disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2017, the life-time risk of dying from maternal causes in sub-Saharan Africa was 1 in 37; in Central and Southern Asia it was 1 in 260; and in Latin America and the Caribbean it was 1 in 630.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the period 2000&#8212;2017, the greatest overall reduction in maternal mortality was achieved in countries in Southern Asia, with a reduction of 59% in the number of deaths (from 384 to 157 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of maternal death can be reduced through better access to modern methods of contraception, and by ensuring that women have access to high-quality care before, during and after childbirth, with an approach that is sensitive to cultural diversity. There has been significant improvement in reducing maternal mortality worldwide, with increased access to skilled care at delivery, the increase in contraceptive prevalence and the decline in fertility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are marked regional disparities in access to modern contraceptive methods, as well as births attended by skilled personnel, with the lowest access to both being in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and sub-Saharan Africa, which is also the region with the highest maternal mortality rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emerging research suggests that Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)&#8211;pandemic-related worries may influence how women feel about having children. Women may be changing their plans&#8211;about when and/or how many children to have.</p>

Women&#8217;s health status during this period is dominated by issues related to their <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/9e5c189d5ee042c1b7f051ece189f018#NH14" target="_blank">sexual and reproductive health</a>. During this period, women and men are likely to form families and enter the labour force, and are considered, on average, too young to die.<strong>&#8211;</strong>Nevertheless, all types of diseases affect the health of people in this age group.</p>
<p>As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO):<span class="footnote-index">1</span> (a) maternal conditions (group 1) represent a leading cause of death for women aged 15&#8212;49, both at the global level and in developing regions; (b) the risk of death from communicable diseases (also in group 1) is highest among women and men at ages 35&#8212;39, when the global death rates from HIV/AIDS peak for both women and men; (c) mortality from non-communicable diseases (group 2) increases with age, and is higher among men; and (d) deaths due to injuries (group 3) are prominent among men aged 15&#8212;49, particularly road accidents, as are deaths from suicide and interpersonal violence.&#8211;</p>

<p>In 2016, among women aged 15-49, the leading causes of death at the global level and in sub-Saharan Africa were HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions. Within the same age group, at the global level men&#8217;s causes of death were dominated by road injuries and ischaemic heart disease.&#8211;</p>
<p>At the regional level, the top leading causes of death among people aged 15-49 were: self-harm (in Australia and New Zealand, and Northern America and Europe, for both women and men), road <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/b0c1d58d7f044717985af52c7b6ad2ab#NH8" target="_blank">injury</a> (in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, for both women and men), and interpersonal violence (in Latin America and the Caribbean, for both women and men). Central and Southern Asia showed a gender difference in the top leading cause of death among people aged 15-49: self-harm for women and road injury for men.</p>
</div></div><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Globally, in 2017, an estimated 295,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth</strong></p>
<p>Worldwide, maternal conditions were the top cause of death among women aged 20&#8212;24 in 2016. The risk of dying from maternal causes is related to the risk of getting pregnant and to the obstetric risk of developing a complication and dying while pregnant, during childbirth or within 42 days postpartum. In resource-poor settings, fertility rates are higher and the risks of dying in labour are greater,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> and thus the risk of dying from maternal causes is greatly amplified. In 2017, the lifetime risk of dying from maternal causes in sub-Saharan Africa was one in 37, in Central and Southern Asia it was one in 260, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it was one in 630 (see figure II).</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made in in reducing maternal mortality since 2000. During the period 2000&#8212;2017, the global maternal mortality rate declined by 38% (from an estimated 342 to 210 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). Over the same period, the greatest overall reduction in the rate was achieved&#8211;in <span class="label-ref">Southern Asia</span>, with a reduction of 59% in the number of maternal deaths (from 384 to 157 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). Four other regions roughly halved their maternal mortality rates during this same period: Central Asia (by 52%), Eastern Asia (by 50%), Europe (by 53%) and Northern Africa (by 54%). All four regions, with the exception of Northern Africa, already had relatively low maternal mortality rates in 2000 (less than 100 per 100,000 live births).<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In 2017, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounted for approximately 86% (254,000) of the estimated global maternal deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa alone accounting for roughly two-thirds (196,000) of maternal deaths, while Southern Asia accounted for nearly one-fifth (58,000).<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Despite its high maternal mortality rate in 2017, <span class="label-ref">sub-Saharan Africa</span> achieved a 40% reduction in maternal mortality in the years since 2000.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_102.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Wide variations in the maternal mortality ratio and lifetime risk suggest that most maternal deaths are preventable</strong></p>
<p>Women die as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these complications develop during pregnancy and are preventable or treatable. Other complications may exist before pregnancy but worsen during pregnancy, especially if not managed as part of a woman&#8217;s health care.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> The major complications, which account for nearly 75% of all maternal deaths, are severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortions.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

<p>Family planning is one of the most important aspects of reproductive health, since the use of modern contraceptive methods allows women to avoid unintended pregnancies. An unintended or unwanted pregnancy may be a pregnancy too early in life, too soon after a previous pregnancy or after a family has been established at a desired size. Like any pregnancy, unwanted pregnancies carry the risk of disability or even death, but they also have added health risks due to the possibility that a woman may choose to have an abortion, and that it might be unsafe. Unlike abortions carried out by skilled personnel in a medically safe environment, unsafe abortions carry a very high risk of complications.</p>
<p>Between 2010&#8212;2014, on average, 56 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year,<span class="footnote-index">15</span> of which around 25 million were unsafe.<span class="footnote-index">16</span> Between 4.7% to 13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion.<span class="footnote-index">17</span> Over half of all estimated unsafe abortions globally were in Asia.

However, it is important to recognize that these figures are an improvement over historic percentages: in sub-Saharan Africa, 23.5% of women of reproductive age had their family planning needs met with a modern contraceptive method in 1990, and in 2010 that figure was 45.70%.<span class="footnote-index">21</span> In general, regions with lower levels of <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/e6d6e1525ef247ef8033c1d0fd0b3a59#NP23" target="_blank">fertility</a> have higher proportions of women using contraception.</p>
