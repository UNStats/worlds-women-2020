<li>Women are not as prepared as men to cope with disasters and other environment-related challenges as they often own fewer assets and rely more heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods. More than half of the economically active women in 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region are engaged in agriculture.</li>
<li>Urban settings offer women economic opportunities but also place many, in particular slum dwellers, at heightened risk of poverty, violence and unsafe living conditions.</li>
<li>There is a gender gap in the likelihood of women and men becoming slum dwellers: in five countries with available data, men living in urban areas were more likely to live in slums, while in four other countries women were more likely to be slum dwellers.</li>
<li>Although the majority of people who lack access to basic drinking water sources live in rural areas, the urban poorest are also deprived in this regard. Since women and girls are disproportionately in charge of water collection, they are particularly affected. For example, the poorest women in urban settings are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water sources than men in Indonesia (10% more likely), Tajikistan (11% more likely), Afghanistan (14% more likely) and Myanmar (32% more likely).</li>
<li>The average amount of time spent on water collection among slum dwellers in the Asia-Pacific region is 15 minutes, although some people spend as long as 6 hours each time they fetch water. In rural areas, people living in the most remote locations may spend up to 15 hours on this task.</li>
</ul>

An analysis of sex-disaggregated data for 12 Asian countries for the period 2012&#8212;2017 indicates that a greater proportion of women than men live in slums (see figure I). While in five of the countries with available data men were more likely to live in slums, meaning that the proportion of men living in slums out of all men living in urban areas was higher than the corresponding figure for women, women were more likely to be slum dwellers in four other countries, Afghanistan, India, Maldives and Nepal.<span class="footnote-index">5</span></p>

For instance, during the wet season in Cambodia, more than 75% of people living in the poorest urban households lack access to basic<span class="footnote-index">9</span> drinking water sources; this figure goes down during the dry season, but still remains above 60%.<span class="footnote-index">10</span> As women and girls are most often in charge of water collection,<span class="footnote-index">11</span> the lack of basic drinking water sources affects them disproportionately. Among the Asian countries with available data, India alone compiles data on water collection roles,<span class="footnote-index">12</span> revealing large gender differentials: in 75% of slum dwellings in India, women are responsible for fetching water<span class="footnote-index">13</span> (see figure II).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_118.png" width="800" /><div class="page"><br /><h4>There is wide variation across countries in the region in time spent in fetching water</h4><div class="content"><p>For women living in slums, the long distances that often need to be covered to fetch water adds a substantial burden to their daily workload. There is wide variation across countries in the amount of time taken to fetch water, from an average of less than seven minutes in Indonesia, to 88 minutes (about one hour and a half) in the Philippines. Although the median time for water collection stands at 15 minutes,<span class="footnote-index">14</span> households located furthest from water sources may spend as long as 6 hours on this essential task.</p>

In Myanmar, for instance, women living in slum households are 10 percentage points<span class="footnote-index">15</span> likelier than men to live in households that lack basic drinking water; a gender gap in access also exists in Afghanistan.<span class="footnote-index">16</span> This may lead to a lack of proper sanitation, exposing women to health risks (see figure III).</p>
<p>In rural areas, where piped water is not as common, people often walk very long distances to collect water: in many rural and remote areas, people, most often women, can spend as long as 15 hours travelling to collect water. On average, rural dwellers spend from about 10 minutes in Indonesia in order to fetch water to 39 minutes in Timor-Leste and 38 minutes in Pakistan.</p>
