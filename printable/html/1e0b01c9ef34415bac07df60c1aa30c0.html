Despite progress over recent decades, gender-based discrimination and violence against women remains a serious problem, which manifests itself in various areas and in multiple forms. <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/f59163868d1d48d59723c8686af8a37b#NV7" target="_blank">Femicide</a><span class="footnote-index">1</span>, described as the most dramatic and extreme form of violence against women, represents an attack on women and their human rights on a daily or exceptional basis in two settings: (a) violence in relationships, whether in a union or not (intimate femicide); and (b) violence inflicted by other persons, whether relatives, people from a woman&#8217;s social environment or strangers, which may derive from situations of social conflict or crime.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Current situation</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>Progress made in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean regarding the codification of femicide as a criminal offence and its statistical visibility have not been effective in reducing this expression of extreme violence against women.</strong> According to the information for the most recent year, as provided by 33 countries in the region to the Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> more than 3,800 women were killed because of their gender.</p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>The incidence of femicide in some countries in Central America remains an acute and worrying problem (see figure I). In 2018, four of the five highest rates of femicide were recorded in Central America: in <span class="label-ref">El Salvador</span> (6.8 femicides per 100,000 women); <span class="label-ref">Honduras</span> (5.1 femicides per 100,000 women), Guatemala (2.0 femicides per 100,000 women); and the Dominican Republic (1.9 femicides per 100,000 women).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_55.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>In the Caribbean, <span class="label-ref">Guyana</span> and <span class="label-ref">Saint Lucia</span> both recorded at least 4 deaths per 100,000 women according to the data provided for the latest available year (see figure II).</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_56.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>In some countries of the region, in the majority of instances, the murders of women are cases of femicide. For example, in <span class="label-ref">El Salvador</span>, three out of five murders of women were recorded as femicides in 2018 &ndash; in other words, 60% involved a component of &#8220;hate or contempt for women&#8221;, as codified in article 45 of the comprehensive Law for a Life Free of Violence against Women passed by the legislature in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>In most countries of the region, 25% to 33% of women have experienced an episode of physical or sexual violence inflicted by a partner.</strong> Those figures are higher in certain countries, such as the Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (58.5%), Colombia (33.3%), Costa Rica (35.8%) and Ecuador (35.5%), where data show that more than one third of women have been subjected to <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/50dd1b2d6167437693178836261522e6#NV1" target="_blank">physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner</a>.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_57.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4></h4><div class="content"><p>In the past few years, social demands relating to ending violence against women and girls have come to the fore. Across Latin America, several countries have experienced a resurgence of social and feminist movements against old and new forms of violence against women.</p>
<p>This indicates the need to link femicide with other forms of violence that are still not included among policy priorities. These various forms of violence persist because they are based on social, political and economic structures that are marked by discriminatory and violent patriarchal patterns in countries in Latin American and the Caribbean.</p>
