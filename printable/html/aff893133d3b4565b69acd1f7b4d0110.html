</div></div><div><br /><h4>Background</h4><div class="content"><p>This narrative provides a blueprint for linking business and social statistics in order to enable an analysis of gender inequalities in trade, particularly in multinational enterprises and foreign trading enterprises. The variables presented are drawn from statistical sources available for many countries, including statistical business registers, foreign affiliate statistics, international trade statistics, structural business statistics and combined employer-employee datasets (see figure I).</p>
<p>Merging data from official statistical datasets and registers enables the enrichment of gender analyses with economic aspects. Assessing gender equality, such as the gender pay gap, in the business sector is facilitated by the availability of indicators disaggregated by firm type and trading status. While most governments are committed to developing a gender-responsive trade policy, effective measures require country-specific indicators<span class="footnote-index">1</span> in order to obtain a full understanding of gender inequalities in trade.</p>
</div></div><img src="../img/image_225.png" width="800" /><div><br /><h4>Microdata linking can improve analyses of trade and gender in Europe</h4><div class="content"><p>Recent work on microdata linking<span class="footnote-index">2</span> and trade in goods by enterprise characteristics<span class="footnote-index">3</span> provide a good starting point for operationalizing trade and gender indicators using the UNCTAD conceptual framework<span class="footnote-index">4</span> and indicators illustrated in a related Finnish case study.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> The findings are in line with research showing that heterogeneous firms have an impact on gendered labour market outcomes,<span class="footnote-index">6</span> specifically on the gender pay gap, especially if they are international trading<span class="footnote-index">7</span> or multinational enterprises.<span class="footnote-index">8</span></p>
</div></div><div><br /><h4>Case study from Finland</h4><div class="content"><p><strong>The share of women in high-paying occupations in exporting and importing (two-way trading) enterprises are significantly lower than in non-trading enterprises</strong></p>
<p>In <span class="label-ref">Finland</span>, the shares of women in different occupations in two-way trading and non-trading enterprises reveal that women participate in trade less often than men, especially in higher paying occupations (see figure II). Thus, women in Finland are less likely to be able to fully benefit from economic globalization. Overall, only some 30% of the workforce in two-way trading enterprises are women, compared to 40% in non-trading enterprises.</p>
<p>When merged, data also show that the <a class="narrative-ref" href="https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/733303cb424641cf9f3ae89ea97874d2#NW21" target="_blank">gender pay gap</a> in Finland tends to be larger in high-paying jobs provided by foreign multinationals and enterprises that trade internationally. Independent firms and those belonging to domestic groups provide more equal pay.<span class="footnote-index">9</span></p>
<p>More specifically, the largest gender pay gaps are found in multinational firms situated in knowledge intensive services compared to independent firms, domestic groups, domestic multinationals and foreign multinationals in three industries: manufacturing, knowledge intensive services and other activities. Data on the wages of women in these industries can help to direct policy attention and measures to address the largest gender pay gaps.</p>

<div class="methodology-definitions">
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>Gender equality in trade indicators measure the preconditions, outcomes and impacts of trade participation for women and men, taking into account their different roles as workers and entrepreneurs, producers and consumers. The indicators require microdata linking of employer and employee datasets to the trading status of enterprises and to various enterprise and individual characteristics to enable in-depth analysis.</p>
