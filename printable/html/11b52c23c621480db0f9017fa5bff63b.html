<li>The largest gender gaps in part-time employment were recorded in the Netherlands (36 percentage points), Pakistan (33 percentage points) and Austria (32 percentage points).</li>

<p>Part-time employment comes at a cost for workers, however, as they oftentimes face difficult working conditions, including lower hourly wages and little job security, and receive less training and promotion opportunities than their full-time counterparts.
