Paternity leave is a short period of leave for the father following the arrival of his child(ren), with the objective of encouraging fathers to assist in childcare and to attend to other family-related responsibilities. Paternity leave has become more common: in 2020, among 188 United Nations Member States and territories with available data worldwide, 103 countries (55%) had provisions on paternity leave, up from the 30 countries (16%) that provided such leave in 1995 (see figure III).</p>\n\n<p>In 2020 in developed regions, new fathers are not entitled to paid paternity leave in Austria, Belarus, Switzerland, Israel, Montenegro, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia and Ukraine. Twenty-six countries in <span class=\"label-ref\">sub-Saharan Africa</span> and 17 countries and territories in <span class=\"label-ref\">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> do not mandate paid time off for new fathers. In 2020, the median length of paid paternity leave worldwide was five days, similar to the corresponding figures observed in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (3 days) and Latin America and the Caribbean (5 days), a low number when compared with the 56 days of paternity leave provided in some high income member States&nbsp;of OECD.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615161517948\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">6</a></span> The European Union work-life balance directive, which entered into force as of 1 August 2019, extends the length of paternity leave in EU member states to at least 10 working days.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615161525873\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">7</a></span></p>\n\n<p>Paternity leave also has significant positive effects on women\u2019s <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/27c1c1ad540347aabc70434238223919#NW1\" target=\"_blank\">employment</a>, with an estimated increase of almost 7% in the proportion of women employed in private firms in developing regions when paternity leave is mandated.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615161532501\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">8</a></span></p>\n",
