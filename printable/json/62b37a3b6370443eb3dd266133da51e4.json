Low proportions of female teachers at the tertiary level (below 30%) were reported in 36 countries, 28 of which were in @@sub-Saharan Africa@@. The other countries with a low representation of female teachers were in Northern Africa and Western Asia (Jordan, Morocco and the State of Palestine), Southern Asia (Afghanistan and Bangladesh) and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (Cambodia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea). Data show, moreover, that the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level tends to be lower in countries with low levels of overall <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/11a30d2e3cfb4e428a5124534a0ee81c#NE10\" target=\"_blank\">enrolment in tertiary education</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The share of female teachers at the tertiary level is significantly lower than their share at the primary and secondary levels</strong></p>\n<p>In most regions of the word, the majority of teachers at the primary level (about 66%) are women, although data reveal variations between countries. Women\u2019s share in teaching drops significantly at higher levels of education: female teachers at the secondary level constitute slightly more than half of the teaching staff; and at the tertiary level, worldwide, the majority of teachers are men. Globally, the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level of education was 43% in 2018.</p>\n",
