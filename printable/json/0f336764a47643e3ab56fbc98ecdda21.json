Findings of the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) project<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1614552383569\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">4</a></span> reveal that women entrepreneurs are less likely than men to fulfil their productive and innovative potential due to a variety of factors, including lack of account ownership (including financial asset accumulation and ownership) and reduced access to external financing through formal channels. In <span class=\"label-ref\">Mongolia</span>, where the proportion of women with financial or mobile-money accounts was four percentage points higher than that of men, data collected in 2016 under the EDGE project revealed that women entrepreneurs were more likely than men to register their businesses in public records (47% versus 32%, respectively)<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1614552411354\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">5</a></span> and were exposed to less economic vulnerability as a result.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, having a financial or mobile-money account increases women\u2019s economic freedom and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/2bc82de401c344b5a2ac90acc7da6299#ND11\" target=\"_blank\">decision-making power in the home</a>, including managing the flow of earnings from employment and/or the stock of owned assets and deciding on major purchases. Furthermore, having a banking account connects women with far more agents in the economy, giving them access to and control over information, networks and payments, such as remittances, installments, wages, taxes and government cash transfers, through reliable and affordable payment systems.</p>\n",
