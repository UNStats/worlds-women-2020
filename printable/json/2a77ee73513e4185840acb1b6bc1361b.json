Inside the household, 78% of unpaid care and domestic work is done by women (see figure V).</p>\n<p>The unequal distribution of unpaid care work inside the household decreases the time women have for study, paid work, self-care, rest and leisure.</p>\n<p>In addition, women in nuclear households with children spend 10 hours per day on unpaid work, twice as much time as women in households without children. During the pandemic, the work burden of women with children has increased due to the temporary closure of schools and day-care centres, as well as the unavailability of paid domestic workers and paid care services.</p>\n",
