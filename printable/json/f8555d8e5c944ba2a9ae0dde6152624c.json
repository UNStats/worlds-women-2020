For example, girls account for more than half of deaths due to lower respiratory infections (52%) and malaria and other vector borne diseases (52%) in children from birth to age 4 (see figure IV). Differences become more noticeable after puberty, however, when physical and behavioural differences between men and women are more marked.</p>\n<p>At ages 15\u201424, stark gender differences in causes of death appear: a significant proportion of young women die of <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/3e45b6c8a7ee424380dc7d8514ac43bf#NH7\" target=\"_blank\">maternal conditions</a>, while young men tend to die of injuries, including road accidents (79% of deaths) and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/b0c1d58d7f044717985af52c7b6ad2ab#NH8\" target=\"_blank\">interpersonal violence</a> (83% of deaths) (see figure IV).

After age 34, deaths from\u00a0non-communicable diseases\u00a0increase, in particular deaths from heart disease and stroke.

Certain cancers (colon and rectum, stomach and liver), most of which occur\u00a0after <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/527e660cda4c470980fca8eca7b2c3fc#NH11\" target=\"_blank\">age 54</a>, tend to be more common among men than women. The exceptions are breast cancers, which affect women almost exclusively. After age 44, maternal conditions are no longer a significant cause of death among women.</p>\n<p>After age 64, other causes of death become more common, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, asthma and certain cancers (including oesophageal, pancreatic and prostate). At older ages (ages 65\u201484) men are more likely than women to die from a range of diseases, with the exception of rheumatic heart disease, which is a cause of death for significant numbers of women aged 65\u201474 (59% of global mortality). After age 84, Alzheimer\u2019s and different types of dementia affect women more than men (56% at ages 85\u2014100). In this latter, most aged, group (85\u2014100), women and men are equally likely to die from a broad range of causes, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, endocarditis or from falls.</p>\n<p>Diabetes and hypertensive heart disease affect men and women of all ages at roughly equal rates, and some of these conditions are easier to prevent and treat than others. While to a certain extent some of these non-communicable diseases can be prevented or their effects reduced through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, others, notably cancer, cannot. However, early detection and modern treatment can greatly reduce mortality for many forms of cancer. WHO estimates that about 30% to 50% of cancers can be prevented with lifestyle modifications, such as eliminating tobacco use, being physically active and reducing exposure to carcinogens in the environment.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span></p>\n",
