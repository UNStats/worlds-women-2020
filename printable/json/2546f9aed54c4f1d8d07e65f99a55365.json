Above the age of 80, women significantly outnumber men among those infected: for every single case of COVID-19 among men aged 80 and older there are 2 cases among women.</li>\n<li>COVID-19 has greatly increased mortality rates among men. Based on data for 38 countries and territories, men have a larger share of deaths across all age groups except among the population aged 80 and older. Between ages 20\u201480, men are significantly overrepresented among COVID-19 deaths: men represent above 60% of deaths&nbsp;in every age group, and 70% among&nbsp;the population aged 40\u201449.</li>\n<li>Although less likely to die from COVID-19, women face additional challenges related to the disease compared to men, including increased risk of domestic violence and abuse due to the isolation measures implemented by governments to curtail the virus spread. Women also comprise 69% of health professionals who&nbsp;are now on the front lines in the battle against the pandemic, facing a higher risk of infection than men in the workplace.</li>\n<li>A range of medications and vaccines are under development or undergoing clinical trials.
