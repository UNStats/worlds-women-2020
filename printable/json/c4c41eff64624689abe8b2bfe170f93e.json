The gross enrolment ratio in secondary education makes no distinction between lower and upper secondary levels, treating enrolment and participation in secondary education as a whole by combining both lower and upper secondary levels into a single educational cycle. Because the gross enrolment ratio includes all students in secondary education regardless of their age, its values can exceed 100% in countries where children enter school late or repeat grades. </span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"methodology-coverage\">\n<h2>Coverage</h2>\n<p>Girls and boys enrolled in secondary education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"methodology-availability\">\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n<p>Data are available for 210 countries for the period 1990\u20142018 (latest available)<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span> in all regional groupings under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicator framework.<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"methodology-note\">\n<h2>Methodological note</h2>\n<p>In some instances, owing to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students because of early or late entrants and/or grade repetition, gross enrolment ratios can exceed 100%. In such cases, a rigorous interpretation of the ratio requires additional information to assess the extent of the effect of those factors. A high gross enrolment ratio generally indicates a high degree of participation, whether pupils belong to the official age group or not. A value approaching or exceeding 100% indicates that a country is, in principle, able to accommodate all of its school-age population, but does not indicate the proportion already enrolled. The achievement of a ratio of 100% is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition for enrolling all eligible children in school. A gross enrolment ratio exceeding 90% for a particular level of education means that the aggregate number of places for students is approaching the number required for universal access of the official age group. However, this is a meaningful interpretation only if it is expected that the under-aged and over-aged enrolment will decline in the future to free up places for pupils from the expected age group. Lower gross enrolment ratios may reflect a shortage of supply, as well as the impact of other factors, such as the indirect and direct costs of attending school, which may limit enrolment. Furthermore, an upward or downward trend in the school-age population can have an impact on the gross enrolment ratio.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
