Adult learning is crucial in maintaining good health, remaining active in the community and staying active in all aspects of society, as well as for improving and developing skills, adapting to technical developments, advancing careers or returning to the labour market.<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span> Adult education programmes are extremely diverse<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span> and differ in terms of objectives, focus, target groups, content, pedagogy and scale. In more developed countries, adult education tends to be more focused on the enhancement of skills, while in the less developed countries the emphasis is more on literacy programmes and the completion of basic education. Moreover, providers of adult education programmes are also diverse, including governments, non-governmental organizations, local communities and employers.</p>\n<p>The indicator on adult participation in learning contributes to the monitoring of progress towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which seeks to ensure that people have access to inclusive and equitable quality education through all stages of life. In addition to promoting formal qualifications, SDG 4 also aims to increase the number of youths and adults with relevant skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.</p>\n",

Sweden had the highest participation rate (43% of women and 26% of men), while in Romania only about 1% of women and men were engaged in adult education.

For those who had attained lower secondary level at most, the participation rate was below 5% for both women and men. There are a number of reasons for this situation, including, in particular, that the demand for training might be higher among individuals with higher levels of education because they already have the skills that facilitate learning and are more likely to be in jobs that demand ongoing training. Regardless of the educational level, in most countries, women\u2019s participation rates were higher than those of men. Gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation rates were significant among individuals with tertiary education.
