With this access guaranteed in laws and regulations in many countries, the future focus must be on ensuring that policies, budgets and actions that can translate the laws into practice.</p>\n<p>In national actions on <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/4086d9f255f7404e9e6d3a949ec42417#NH10\" target=\"_blank\">HIV, in particular</a>, on average, countries have enacted 87% of enabling laws and regulations for HIV counselling and test services; 91% for HIV treatment and care services; and 96% of laws needed for ensuring HIV confidentiality. In addition, countries have 79% of relevant enabling laws and regulations that stipulate full, free and informed consent of individuals before they receive contraceptive services, including sterilization (see figure II). This data indicate that there is a broadly supportive framework protecting women from coerced or forced practices.</p>\n<p>In terms of laws and regulations on sexuality education, on average, countries have only 57% of the enabling laws, regulations or national policies needed to make a <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/16fd3d35d4124b5891509f9970597e8b#NE18\" target=\"_blank\">sexuality education</a> a mandatory component of the national school curriculum (see figure II). In countries with those laws and regulations in place, 75% of such frameworks include all key concepts recommended by international norms and standards for sexuality education. In 90%, all but two concepts, relationships, and sexuality and sexual behaviour, are included.</p>\n<p>In many countries, there are legal barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, the most prevalent in blocking legal access to abortion. Although abortion is legal on some or all grounds in 93% of reporting countries, in 28% of those countries a husband\u2019s consent is required in order for married women to access abortion services. Moreover, women may be criminally charged for having an illegal abortion in more than 50% of the 107 reporting countries.</p>\n<p>Although there are laws and regulations guaranteeing access to <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/3e45b6c8a7ee424380dc7d8514ac43bf#NH7\" target=\"_blank\">maternity care</a> in almost all countries with data (95%), 9% of those countries have restrictions based on marital status and 10% have restrictions based on age. Access to contraceptive services is also restricted in some countries. In 21% of countries, third party authorization (consent by parent, spouse, judge or medical committee) is required to access contraceptive services. Moreover, 20% of countries have multiple legal systems, for example at the state level, some of which can contradict some or all of the national laws and regulations on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in the country.</p>\n",
