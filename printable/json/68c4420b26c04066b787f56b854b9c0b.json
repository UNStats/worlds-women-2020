SDG indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women\u2019s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. SDG indicator 5.a.1 measures the extent to which women are disadvantaged in ownership/tenure rights over agricultural land. SDG indicator 5.a.1 is divided in two sub-indicators: (a) proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"methodology\">\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n\n<h3>Measurement of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 5.a.2</h3>\n\n<p>Indicator 5.a.2 measures the extent to which a country\u2019s legal framework supports women\u2019s land rights by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615164359181\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">6</a></span> which has been ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests,<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615164365709\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">7</a></span> endorsed unanimously by the Committee of Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives.</li>\n\t<li>B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions.</li>\n\t<li>C: Women\u2019s and girls\u2019 equal inheritance rights.</li>\n\t<li>D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women\u2019s ownership and control over land.</li>\n\t<li>E: In legal systems that recognize customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women.</li>\n\t<li>F: Mandate for women\u2019s participation in land management and administration institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the context of the reporting on the SDGs, in the case of SDG indicator 5.a.2, countries are classified according to the total number of proxies found in primary legislation or in primary and secondary legislation. Given that customary land tenure rules do not exist in all countries nor is customary law recognized (related to proxy E), for the purpose of computation, a two-scale (or dual) approach has been developed.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615164374588\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">8</a></span></p>\n\n<h3>Measurement of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 5.a.1</h3>\n\n<p>Based on the recommendations from seven field tests carried out under the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) initiative,<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1615164384747\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">9</a></span> three proxies have been identified to measure ownership or tenure rights over agricultural land:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1.

All available data were collected and validated by the reporting countries. As custodian agency, FAO carried out the quality assessment and aggregation of results.
