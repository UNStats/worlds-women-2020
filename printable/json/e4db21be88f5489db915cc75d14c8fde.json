                    "content": "<p>The availability of data on sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner is much lower than that for intimate partner violence.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to collect such data, surveys have relied on different methodologies, used different definitions of sexual violence, formulated different questions and sampled diverse age groups. In addition, willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to cultural context, a factor that can affect reported prevalence levels and the overall comparability of international data.</p>\n<p>A further challenge is the formulation of the time frame of \u201cprevious 12 months\u201d in SDG indicator 5.2.2. This is a problem for two reasons: firstly, far fewer countries have measured non-partner sexual violence in the preceding 12 months compared with sexual violence over the lifetime; secondly, in surveys it is often reported that the rate of past-year sexual violence for an aggregate age group of women aged 15 and older is close to zero. This very low point estimate of prevalence makes the assessment of changes over time difficult, particularly when data are presented disaggregated by age.</p>\n<p>These factors make monitoring trends at the country, regional and international levels difficult.</p>\n<p>Efforts are ongoing to develop international estimates of sexual violence by non-partners that account for methodological differences between studies, which will improve comparisons between countries, and enable the monitoring of trends and inform policies.</p>\n",
