It is a key driver of sustainable development, which enables greater participation in the labour market and civic life. A lack of literacy skills is strongly correlated with poverty and exclusion from social and economic opportunities. The benefits of literacy, in particular for women, are well documented, including increased participation in the labour market, delayed marriage and improved child and family health and nutrition, all of which reduce poverty and expand life opportunities. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development1 literacy is highlighted as a public good, the foundation of basic education, and Sustainable Development Goal 4, target 4.6, specifically calls on countries to ensure that by 2030 \u201call youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy\u201d.\n",

At the global level, the gender gap in the youth literacy rates has been steadily closing (from about 8 percentage points in 1995 to about 2 percentage points in 2018), although disparities persist across and within regions. Gender parity in literacy among youth has been attained in the majority of regions, and data show remarkable improvement among adult populations, with a steady reduction in gender gaps from about 13 percentage points in 1995 to 7 percentage points in 2018.

In some countries gender disparities among the adult population are particularly pronounced. For example, in Chad and Guinea-Bissau, less than 50 adult females are literate for every 100 literate males. Even among the youth population, gender inequalities can be stark in some countries, with less than 60 literate females for every 100 males in  and the Central African Republic. Similar, although less extreme, disparities against female youth are also evident in other countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Liberia and the Niger, as demonstrated in gender inequalities in school enrolment and learning.\nDespite the steady rise in literacy rates over the past few decades, more progress is needed to achieve SDG target 4.6, which aims to ensure that all youth and most adults achieve literacy and numeracy by 2030. This requires scaling up literacy and skills programmes and collaborating with civil society partners, particularly aimed at reaching girls and women and vulnerable groups, and integrating such programmes with skills development for decent work and livelihoods as essential elements of lifelong learning.\n",
