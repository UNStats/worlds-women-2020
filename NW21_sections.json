The explained factors combine: (a) the individual characteristics of women and men in the labour market; (b) the types of jobs they perform; and (c) the types of establishments or companies in which they work, and includes age, level and field of education, work experience, occupation, economic sector, type of contract and working time of employed women and men, as well as the age, size, legal status and private/foreign/state ownership of the establishments in which they work. Gender inequalities in most of these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes (influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men) as well as difficulties in balancing work and family life, which often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly among women.1\n",

In most countries, women earned less than men, and the median gender pay gap for these 58 countries was 12% in favour of men. However, a gender pay gap in favour of women was found in Latin America and the Caribbean, where statistics on earnings were produced from a variety of data sources with discrepancies in coverage, scope and characteristics. In that region, in more than half the countries with available data for the period 2014\u20142018, men earned less than women. Among 33 countries in Europe with more comparable data on the gender pay gap during the same time period, women were generally paid less than men, with a gender pay gap in the region ranging between 2% and 28%. Six countries, namely, Austria, Estonia, Germany, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, had the largest gender pay gaps in the region, amounting to more than 20%. Average hourly earnings of employed women and men differed the most in countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, although data were available for only five countries: the gender pay gap was calculated as 22% in favour of women in Thailand (with women earning more) and 31% in favour of men in the Republic of Korea (with men earning more) (see figure I).\n",

Earnings exclude employers\u2019 contributions on behalf of employees to social security and pension schemes and the benefits received by employees under these schemes, as well as severance and termination pay. This indicator is used to calculate the gender pay gap.\n\n\nGender pay gap: difference between the average hourly wages of men and women expressed as a percentage of the average hourly wages of men, as follows:\n                                [Average hourly earnings of men \u2013 Average hourly earnings of women] / [Average hourly earnings of men]\n                                \n\n\n\n\nCoverage\nEmployed women and men. Differences in coverage in terms of minimum age, working time and economic sectors may be observed across different data sources. \n\n\nAvailability\n58 United Nations Member States and territories (with latest available data for the period 2014\u20142018). Countries and territories are organized under the regional groupings of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators framework.10\n\n\nStatistics on earnings are obtained from various data sources. Most countries in developing regions rely on labour force surveys or household income and expenditure surveys, while most countries in developed regions rely on establishment surveys. Cross-country comparisons of earnings data from different data sources are affected by type and age of workers covered, as well as by the exclusion of certain economic sectors. International comparability is hampered by differences across countries in the size criterion adopted in surveys or censuses. In addition, the average earnings of particular groups, including women, are affected by the different elements that make up the groups and their characteristics. Furthermore, earnings reflected in SDG indicator 8.5.1 may omit earnings of part-time workers and/or of domestic workers, depending on the data source. This is particularly relevant given that women are more likely to hold part-time jobs and to work as domestic workers than men and that both part-time and domestic workers generally have lower hourly earnings. \n\n\n",
