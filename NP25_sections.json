That decrease was due to amendments made to the Provisional Personal Status Law No. 82 in 2001 to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18.\nHowever, early marriage among women aged 20\u201424, particularly those who married before age 15, increased significantly in recent years (a five-fold increase between 2012 and 2017), from almost zero to 1.5%. During the same period, the proportion of women aged 20\u201424 who married before age 18 registered a moderate increase, from 8.4% to 9.7%. The increase in child marriage in Jordan between 2012 and 2017 resulted from a number of factors, including poverty and population growth owing to the influx of foreigners into Jordan as a result of armed conflicts in neighbouring countries.2\n",
