Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that seriously inhibits women\u2019s ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men (Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, general recommendation 19).2 \nThe economic and social costs of violence against women are significant. Data from countries all over the world show that violence undermines development at various levels, leading to the devaluation of physical, human and social capital.\nKazakhstan, like many other States Members of the United Nations, is party to major international commitments in the field of gender equality, including those contained in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,3 as well as those set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 target 5.2 of which specifically calls for the elimination of all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.5\n",

        "content": "\nThe study also found that women who reported that their mother had experienced physical or psychological abuse were significantly more likely to report experiencing physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence themselves.\nFactors that contribute to the likelihood of intimate partner violence include: personality profiles and current behaviours of the partners in a relationship; specific dynamics of the relationship, including levels of conflict, communication styles and power dynamics; household and community structures in which the relationship is embedded; and the macro-level and global-level forces that shape prevailing norms, access to resources and the relative standing of women versus men.\nIn Kazakhstan intimate partner violence is also driven by a range of factors at all levels of society. According to available data, in addition to the main underlying issue, gender inequality, other contributing factors include, inter alia:\n                \nMen\u2019s control over women in intimate relationships: one in three women reported that they had experienced at least one act of controlling behaviour by a partner in their lifetime;\nCurrent laws do not specifically criminalize domestic violence, which promotes impunity and sends a message that domestic violence is tolerated;\nChildren witnessing intimate partner violence may be traumatized and or become accustomed to a learned pattern of behaviour and accept violence as normal.\n\n\nWomen who reported ever having experienced any physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in their lifetimes were asked follow-up questions about seeking support in response to their current or former partner\u2019s behavior, for example, if they had ever told anyone about it. Overall, around half (51%) of the respondents said that they had never told anyone, which means that, for many women, the study interviewer was the first person that they had ever talked to about their experiences.\nAmong women who had told someone about their experience of intimate partner violence, most had told their own parents (23%), their partner\u2019s parents (21%), their friends (14%) or other relatives (10%). Very few women said that they had talked to people in positions of authority \u2014 only 8% of women who experienced intimate partner violence had told the police about their partner\u2019s behaviour, and only 3% had told a doctor or other medical worker. \nAddressing violence against women remains challenging: women are often ashamed to share their experiences with others and face a range of social prejudices, and moreover they may be unaware of their rights and lack information about existing support centres. Many women who shared their stories with interviewers were grateful for the opportunity to voice their concerns and ease their minds, as well as to obtain information about existing laws and institutions that support women living with the daily risk of violence in the home.\n",
