Although academic achievement is associated with higher income levels,3 other factors play an influential role, including gender: income levels are statistically higher for men than for women \u2014 a manifestation of gender inequality. The difference between the wages earned by the most highly educated women and those of their male counterparts is more pronounced when ethnicity and race are factored in: with 13 years of schooling or more, men who are neither indigenous nor Afrodescendents earn the highest incomes, followed by Afrodescendent men, non-indigenous and non-Afrodescendent women, Afrodescendent women, indigenous men and, lastly, indigenous women, who are the most disadvantaged. \n",

        "content": "\nIn Latin America, the notions of race and ethnicity that are part of the political identity of Afrodescendents and indigenous people have made it possible to create the basis for these populations to self-identify in censuses and surveys, and thus to overcome the statistical invisibility that is another form of discrimination.4 Data disaggregated by ethnicity and race have shown that average fertility rates for Afrodescendents and indigenous populations are statistically higher than national averages and that of the rest of the population.5 Indigenous people tend to be part of larger households, with an average of 4.7 people per household, compared with an average of 3.9 for those who are neither indigenous nor Afrodescendents. The presence of children in the household often increases the hours of unpaid work of women, and also of men, although not by comparable levels.6\nTraditionally, and from early ages, indigenous women, especially in rural areas, are expected to carry out numerous daily tasks that require a large investment of time, such as caring for members of the family and the community, providing households with basic supplies (fetching water or gathering firewood), caring for animals and collaborating on agricultural work. This burden of unpaid work limits women\u2019s ability to fully participate in the labour market. In addition, as has been well documented, indigenous women, in particualar, are overrepresented among the poor and have less access to productive resources and land ownership.7\nTime-use surveys show that the gender gap in terms of time spend on unpaid work is wider within indigenous populations in all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with available data (see figure II). Indigenous women may spend up to six hours more per week on unpaid work than non-indigenous women, which is the case in Ecuador and Mexico. This underscores the importance of considering the strict gender division of labour in indigenous households, the need for care policies and basic infrastructure to support indigenous families, particularly those living in rural areas, and the barriers to women\u2019s economic autonomy. For further information on the intersection of gender, household type and unpaid work, the report on the impact of unpaid work on the economy of Mexican households provides in-depth analysis.\n                \n",
