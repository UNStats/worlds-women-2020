Furthermore, programmes outside school may be the only means of imparting knowledge and life skills education to young people in places where <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH14\">teaching about sexuality</a> and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH10\">HIV and AIDS</a> in school is highly sensitive or forbidden. Life skills education outside school is likely to be most effective when it complements other services targeting young people. Voluntary and anonymous participation offered by youth drop-in centres can enhance the reach and effectiveness of such programmes. </p>\n<p>Moreover, whether life skills-based HIV and sexuality education is offered inside or outside a formal educational setting, it needs to reflect the fact that girls and boys have different needs and vulnerabilities. Single gender groups, with a teacher or facilitator of the same gender, can foster more open communication on sensitive issues. For example, as part of the \u201cSister 2 Sister\u201d initiative in Malawi, \u201cbig sisters\u201d (older young women) share their knowledge and life-skills experiences with young women aged 15\u201419. Overall, the programme has led to increased knowledge in the areas of sexuality, HIV, condom use, multiple and concurrent partners, age-disparate relationships and health-seeking behaviours, and there is evidence that such knowledge is sustained over time.<span class=\"footnote-index\">x</span></p>\n",
