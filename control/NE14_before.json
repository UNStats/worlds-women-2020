The ways in which skills develop are influenced by the formative education and employment choices and paths young people pursue. In a comparison survey of students at age&nbsp;15 carried out under the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development (OECD), followed by a Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies survey 12 years later, significant changes in disparities were reported: wide literacy gaps between girls and boys narrowed or disappeared in young adulthood. At age 15, girls in OECD countries outperformed boys in reading, but by age 27, the gender gap had almost completely closed.<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span></p>\n",

The indicator is calculated as the percentage of children and young people at the relevant stage of education achieving or exceeding a predefined minimum proficiency level in a given subject. The minimum proficiency level is defined as the benchmark of basic knowledge in a given domain (reading and mathematics) measured through learning assessments. Currently, there are no common standards for a global benchmark. Since each learning assessment sets its own objectives and standards, the performance levels defined in these assessments may not be consistent.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"methodology-coverage\">\n<h2>Coverage</h2>\n\n<p>Girls and boys: (a) in grades 2 or 3 of primary education; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"methodology-availability\">\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n\n<p>Data for grades 2 or 3 of primary education are available for 73 countries for reading and 66 for mathematics.
