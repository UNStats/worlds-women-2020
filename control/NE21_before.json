A higher level of educational attainment indicates the availability of a relatively high level of skills and knowledge in the labour force. The greater the level of educational attainment, the more likely it is that individuals will have the relevant skills for employment and entrepreneurship, and the greater their earning potential.</p>\n<p> In addition to preparing individuals for the labour market, high levels of educational attainment also have a positive impact on broader social development goals, including increased levels of participation and representation in government and of political influence. Persons with higher levels of educational attainment are usually better equipped to make well-informed decisions, for example about their personal and family health or the environment. Raising educational attainment is a key mechanism for empowering women, improving their access to well-paid jobs, increasing their representation in government and enhancing their political influence. </p>\n",

However, they provide a basis for broad comparison of educational attainment across regions. It is also important to bear in mind that comparability of data is limited because of differing definitions pertaining to educational attainment used by countries and because educational systems in different countries do not necessarily impart the same degree of skills and knowledge at each level of education.

Also, certain educational programmes and courses of study cannot be easily classified under ISCED.
