A higher level of educational attainment indicates the availability of a relatively high level of skills and knowledge in the labour force. The greater the level of educational attainment, the more likely it is that individuals will have the relevant skills for employment and entrepreneurship, and the greater their earning potential.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to preparing individuals for the labour market, high levels of educational attainment also have a positive impact on broader social development goals, including increased levels of participation and representation in government and of political influence. Persons with higher levels of educational attainment are usually better equipped to make well-informed decisions, for example about their personal and family health or the environment. Raising educational attainment is a key mechanism for empowering women, improving their access to well-paid jobs, increasing their representation in government and enhancing their political influence.</p>\n",

However, they provide a basis for broad comparison of educational attainment across regions. It is also important to bear in mind that comparability of data is limited because of differing definitions pertaining to educational attainment used by countries and because educational systems in different countries do not necessarily impart the same degree of skills and knowledge at each level of education. (\u21e1 back to text)</li>\n\t<li>The educational attainment category of \u201cno schooling\u201d refers to all persons who have attended less than one grade at the primary level; \u201cprimary\u201d comprises those who have completed primary education (ISCED 1) or at least one grade of primary education; \u201csecondary\u201d represents those who have attended lower secondary (ISCED 2), upper secondary (ISCED 3) or post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED 4); and \u201ctertiary\u201d comprises those who have attended any level of tertiary education (ISCED 5-8). (\u21e1 back to text)</li>\n\t<li>Caution is required when using this indicator for cross-country comparison, since countries do not always classify degrees and qualifications using the same levels as those set out in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), even if they are received at roughly the same age or after a similar number of years of schooling. Also, certain educational programmes and courses of study cannot be easily classified under ISCED. This indicator only measures educational attainment in terms of level of education attained, that is, years of schooling, and does not necessarily reveal the quality of education (learning achievement and other impacts).
