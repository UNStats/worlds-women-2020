However, there are no internationally agreed criteria to establish these differentiated thresholds. A third alternative is to include additional indicators that are \u201cgender-informed\u201d, that is, indicators that apply to both girls and boys but that are more likely to capture differences between them.</p>\n",

It does not call for disaggregation by \u201cage and sex;\u201d instead, it mentions specifically multidimensional poverty of \u201cmen, women, and children\u201d. Moreover, a household-level estimate may omit children suffering material deprivations in families that are not counted as poor due to indicators related to adults. In some countries, this omission could be as high as 20%\u201430% of all children (or about half of all poor children).

In the case of education, the majority of countries in the world have reached gender parity in primary school attendance, and parity is also close in secondary school in many countries.

However, there should not be a separate dimension labelled \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cgender\u201d as it would not be comparable to the other dimensions, all of which match a right.

The two specific questions that are asked of respondents are: \u201cDid you use any materials such as sanitary pads, tampons or cloth?\u201d and \u201cDuring your last menstrual period were you able to wash and change in privacy while at home?\u201d. Both are answered either yes or no. No deprivation occurs when both answers are \u201cyes\u201d while severe deprivations is established if both answers are \u201cno\u201d.
