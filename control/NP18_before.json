                    "content": "<p>In 17 countries with available data in the Europe and Northern America region, there were more couples-with-children than one-parent households (ranging from 22% in Ukraine to 40% in Spain), although a significant proportion of households included children that lived with a single parent, in particular with a lone mother (ranging from 5% in Albania to 10% in Belarus) (see figure IV). Households composed of couples without children were also prevalent in all countries, with share ranges between 15% in Poland and Slovenia to 26% in Canada. In the <span class=\"label-ref\">Unites States</span>, childless-couple households (25%) were slightly more common than households made up of couples with children (24%) and the percentage of lone-mother households with children (7%) and lone-father households with children (2%) reflected regional trends. The observed distribution of households with or without children, particularly in OECD countries, may be linked to changes in marriage and fertility patterns.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> The relatively low levels of couples with children should therefore be interpreted keeping in mind the associated low levels of fertility in those countries.</p>\n\n<p>Information on the incidence of lone parenting should be examined in the context of the welfare of the persons involved, both children and parents. Statistics show that, globally, lone mothers with at least one child under the age of 6 are more likely to be in the <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW1\" target=\"_blank\">labour force</a> (65.8%) than mothers living with a partner and a young child (48.7%), presumably because lone mothers bear the sole responsibility for providing for the household.</p>\n\n<p>These statistics reveal the extent of the economic pressure of the care burden placed on lone mothers in providing for themselves and for their children, which may have implications on the welfare of both mothers and children. At present, there are insufficient sampled data to produce reliable labour force estimates on the welfare lone-father households, possibly owing to the fact that they are less common.<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span></p>\n",
