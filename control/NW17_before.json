The presence of children in the household often increases the hours of unpaid work of women, and also of men, although not by comparable levels.<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span></p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, and from early ages, indigenous women, especially in rural areas, are expected to carry out numerous daily tasks that require a large investment of time, such as caring for members of the family and the community, providing households with basic supplies (fetching water or gathering firewood), caring for animals and collaborating on agricultural work. This burden of <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW25\" target=\"_blank\">unpaid work</a> limits women\u2019s ability to fully <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW1\" target=\"_blank\">participate in the labour market</a>. In addition, as has been well documented, indigenous women, in particualar, are overrepresented among the poor and have less access to productive resources and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW12\" target=\"_blank\">land ownership</a>.<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span></p>\n\n<p>Time-use surveys show that the gender gap in terms of time spend on unpaid work is wider within indigenous populations in all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with available data (see figure II). Indigenous women may spend up to six hours more per week on unpaid work than non-indigenous women, which is the case in Ecuador and Mexico. This underscores the importance of considering the strict gender division of labour in indigenous households, the need for care policies and basic infrastructure to support indigenous families, particularly those living in rural areas, and the barriers to women\u2019s economic autonomy.
