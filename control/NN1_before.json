                    "content": "\n\n<p>Environmental decision-making occurs at all levels, including through: participation of delegates to multilateral environmental agreements; climate change funding mechanisms; national level parliamentarians, environmental ministries and other government bodies; state and local officials; community-based conservation organizations; and household decision-making. In all such arenas, the unique voice and agency of women is a vital part of the decision-making process for the governance of natural resources, in particular in the development of gender-responsive policies. The perspectives of women have often gone unrecognized in decision-making spheres and their needs left out in the shaping of environmental policy.<span class=\"footnote-index\">10</span> Without their active participation, women\u2019s needs, vulnerabilities, strengths and knowledge will be missing from environmental policies, and this is especially true because women and men interact with, rely upon, have access to and manage environmental resources differently, and are differently impacted by the effects of climate change. </p>\n<p>Numerous efforts have been made to ensure that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are central to the decision-making processes relevant to the environment and sustainable development,<span class=\"footnote-index\">11</span> and all three Rio Conventions<span class=\"footnote-index\">12</span> include provisions addressing the importance of gender equality and women\u2019s participation. The Convention on Biological Diversity recommends, inter alia, that States parties take action to measure and monitor women\u2019s participation and to include both women and men in capacity-building efforts and the development and dissemination of information on the Convention in ways that are accessible to both sexes.<span class=\"footnote-index\">13</span></p>\n<p>Although efforts have been made to measure women\u2019s participation in environmental decision-making, data gaps remain. Participation in the meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to the Rio Conventions is one of the more reliably monitored and reported aspects of women\u2019s inclusion in decision-making processes in the environmental sphere. In this regard, the Women\u2019s Environment &amp; Development Organization (WEDO) found that women made up 39% of national delegations to the United Nations Climate Conference in 2019, and that 21% of the heads of delegations were women. In contrast, at the 2015 Climate Change Conference, women comprised 32% of delegations and only 10% of heads of delegations were women.<span class=\"footnote-index\">14</span></p>\n<p>SDG target 5.5 sets the goal of ensuring women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life,<span class=\"footnote-index\">15</span> and indicator 5.5.1 addresses how to measure the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and local governments. In 2015, in an assessment of the extent of women\u2019s leadership in national-level environmental sectors, the International Union for Conservation of Nature found that across 881 national environmental-sector <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#ND3\">ministries</a> from 193 United Nations Member States, only 12% of ministers were women.  In 2020, worldwide, 25% of <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#ND6\">parliamentarians</a> are women.<span class=\"footnote-index\">16</span> </p>\n",
