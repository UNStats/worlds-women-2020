Furthermore, in some countries unequal laws and institutions and capacity gaps continue to restrict women\u2019s ability to run for office.

Countries that have reached or surpassed the 30% minimum target in representation of women in parliament have all adopted gender quotas: Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all countries with more than 30% of parliamentary seats held by women, have quotas and proportional representation as part of their electoral systems.<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span></p>\n\n<p>The quota system differs from one country to another. The main systems used in the continent include legislated candidate quotas, reserved seats and voluntary political party quotas. An assessment made by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> in 33 African countries shows that approximately 40% adopted legislated candidate quota, about 40% reserved seats and just over 24% adopted voluntary political party quotas.</p>\n\n<p>Rwanda, for example, has statutory provisions reserving 30% of seats for women in its bicameral legislature, while South Africa\u2019s municipal structures require that political parties ensure \u201cthat 50% of the candidates on the party list are women\u201d and that \u201cwomen must be fairly represented in a constituency committee.\u201d However, having a gender quota is no guarantee of an increase in the representation of women in parliaments. Other conditions are necessary. In the Niger, after the adoption of a quota system to ensure the representation of women in elected offices, the Government and public administration, there was a significant increase in the presence of women in parliament (from 1.2% in 1999 to 17% in the 2016 elections); this was not the case, however, in terms of women\u2019s representation in local governance. Women\u2019s representation in local governing bodies remains below the quotas set by law (25% for the cabinet and senior positions in the public service and 15% for both sexes in parliament for legislative and local elections).<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span></p>\n",

Increased representation of women has been observed, however, in some countries, including Cameroon (49.3% in 2014), the Niger (49.3% in 2017), Seychelles (47.8% in 2018), Namibia (43.6% in 2018), Cape Verde (43.4% in 2018), Eswatini (43.4% in 2016) and Zambia (40.5 in 2018).
