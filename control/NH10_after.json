While the incidence of TB appears to increase as men grow older, it remains relatively constant across age for women. Regional differences, with incidence among women consistently lower than men, were also significant (see figure III). Incidence was highest in <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"Oceania\">Oceania</span>  (excluding Australia and New Zealand), with 6.5 new notified cases per 100,000 for men and 2.4 per 100,000 for women, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia. Regional gender gaps in the incidence of TB also varied significantly, with the largest gender gap reported in Northern America and Europe, where men are 2.2 times more likely than women to be infected by TB, followed by Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, where men are almost twice as likely to be infected by TB as women. </p>\n<p>The higher estimated incidence among men may be partly explained by men being more likely to smoke or drink.<span class=\"footnote-index\">24</span> <span class=\"footnote-index\">25</span> As reported by WHO, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Central and Southern Asia are the top three regions in terms of prevalence of <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH6\">tobacco smoking</a> among men. The prevalence of smoking in adult men (aged over 15) is above 40% in 10 of the 30 countries with high incidence of TB.<span class=\"footnote-index\">26</span> Immunological reasons for an excess of TB infection in men have also been proposed.<span class=\"footnote-index\">27</span></p>\n<p>Male TB patients appear to be less likely to seek care than female TB patients, as reflected in lower rates of case notification compared with the estimated total of cases (see figure III). As a consequence, male patients remain infectious in the community longer than female patients. There is a need for strategies to improve access to and use of health-care services among men, not only to address gender inequities but also to reduce infection to greatest extent possible. Potential strategies include the more active targeting of men with routine diagnostic and screening services.</p>\n<p>Even though globally men are significantly more at risk of contracting and dying from TB than women, TB can have particularly severe consequences for women, especially during their reproductive years and during pregnancy. TB among mothers is associated with a six-fold increase in perinatal deaths and a two-fold risk of premature birth and low birth-weight; TB in pregnant women living with HIV increases the risk of maternal and infant mortality by almost 400%.<span class=\"footnote-index\">28</span></p>\n<p>Modelling suggests that if the <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"Covid\">COVID-19</span> pandemic leads to a 25% global reduction in expected TB detection for three months, a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption being observed in multiple countries, a 13% rise in TB deaths might be expected. This would mean that global mortality rates from TB infection could return to those seen five years ago.<span class=\"footnote-index\">29</span> </p>\n",
