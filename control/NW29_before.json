This is partly related to the size and dependency ratio of lowest-income households, which tend to have specific family structures.<span class=\"footnote-index\">1</span></p>\n\n<p>The differences in unpaid working time are significant: while women in the <span class=\"label-ref\">poorest</span> households (quantile I, poorest 20% of households) spend an average of 39 hours per week on unpaid work, those in the wealthiest households (quantile V, wealthiest 20% of households) spend around 29 hours per week on unpaid work, an average of 10 hours less. Meanwhile, the differences in the amount of time spent on unpaid work between men in households in the poorest and wealthiest quintiles is not significant, generally less than one hour per day.</p>\n\n<p>Data show that men\u2019s contribution to domestic and care work is generally independent of their socioeconomic stratum, and that the gender gap in time spent on unpaid work is wider and more unequal in lowest-income households.</p>\n\n<p>Monetary poverty and lack of time sustain a vicious circle that is difficult to break without policies focused on strengthening women\u2019s economic autonomy. The burden of unpaid work that has historically been assigned to women hinders their access to the labour market and thus their ability to generate their own income; this situation is even more pronounced in households with children under the age of five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition, women in poor households are unable to acquire goods and services that could save time on domestic and care work and there is a lack of quality public services that provide care for children, older persons and persons with disabilities and with chronic illnesses, a regressive situation that is set to worsen, given the ongoing demographic changes in the region, including a rise in the older population.</p>\n",
