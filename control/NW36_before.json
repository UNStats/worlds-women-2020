This gap shows no signs of changing over time (it was 9.3 percentage points in 1998), exceeding 13 percentage points over the period 2009\u20142016.

In 1998, 62.7% of the population aged 18 and over read newspapers at least once a week, a share that had dropped to 38.9% in 2019. There has been a modest recovery in readership due to the interest in online products (which was 32.5% in 2019), which has brought total newspaper readership (both paper and digital) to 52.2%, or 46% for women and 58% for men, resulting in a gender gap of 12 percentage points in 2019 (see Figure V). </p>\n",
