Data on household financial decision-making provide valuable information on individual agency and the empowerment of women across societies. This topic has direct policy relevance for social welfare and development programmes aimed at increasing economic well-being through income transfers, the outcomes of which depend on access to income.

Recent surveys indicate that in Australia and in 12 countries in Europe decisions about occasional more expensive purchases are largely egalitarian. On average, more than 80% of women and men indicated that decisions about expensive purchases are shared equally between partners.<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span> </p>\n<p>The situation with regard to decision-making on routine purchases for the household is quite different. In most countries with available data, decisions about day-to-day household purchases are most frequently taken by women alone (see figure I). While participation in financial decision-making is an important marker of the empowerment of women, sole responsibility in this area may not be desirable. Sustainable Development Goal 5, target 5.4, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for \u201cthe promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family\u201d. That women perceive themselves as being principally responsible for decisions about routine purchases may indicate an imbalance in the management of domestic tasks. Responsibility for deciding how to spend money on food, clothing and items for daily living may reflect obligation rather than autonomy or influence; the responsibility for deciding on how money is spent on a car, home remodelling or a vacation may be more indicative of power.</p>\n",
