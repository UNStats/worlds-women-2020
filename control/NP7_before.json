Current data suggest that the proportion of women and girls among internally displaced persons is often higher than among the national population. The higher numbers of forcibly displaced women compared to men are often linked to socioeconomic factors and local conflict dynamics. In the case of armed conflict, this may be explained by the fact that men often stay behind to fight, while women tend to flee for safety along with dependent family members.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> </p>\n",

Internal displacement also has an impact on women\u2019s ability to find shelter and security, to access services such as education and health care and to participate in decision-making processes.<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span> A recent study conducted by the Government of Colombia<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span> revealed that conflict and forced displacement exacerbates discrimination and violence against women, leaving forcibly displaced women more exposed to <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NV2\">sexual</a> and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NV1\">domestic</a> violence and labour exploitation. It also showed that forcibly displaced women often face greater obstacles in access to education and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW12\">land ownership</a>, as well as in making their voices heard in public and political spheres.</p>\n<p>In situations of forced displacement, women\u2019s economic activities are significant and crucial, often contributing to the livelihood of their families and communities and to the strengthening of their economic stability. However, as observed in some studies, women may also be empowered in such scenarios as there may be more space for them to participate in decision-making and in activities outside the home. Although displacement is a traumatic experience, it may also be a space for redefining and negotiating pre-existing roles, which can lead to an improvement of women\u2019s previous circumstances and social status. A recent report assessed the impact of displacement on the gender roles and relations of women and girls who were forced to move from a rural area to a peri-urban area in Pakistan. Before displacement, livelihood opportunities had been limited for women, who were mostly able to engage in activities related to household and agricultural work. After moving, women were obliged to look for alternative sources of income, such as sewing, which allowed them to earn money and to manage their earnings independently. In addition, the perception of the importance of girls\u2019 education, which was previously regarded as superfluous, was altered owing to displacement. Other life-changing transformations were possible due to greater access to amenities such as running water, cooking gas and electricity, which reduced the amount of time women and girls dedicated to domestic chores.<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span></p>\n<p>However, in order to increase and maintain women\u2019s livelihood opportunities, further transformation needs to take place within the household, the community and within institutions. This should be accompanied by the long-term and continuous development of non-economic aspects, such as women\u2019s access to education, and the implementation of laws and policies supporting women\u2019s empowerment. Increased availability of disaggregated data on internal displacement is also crucial to a better understanding and response to the needs of displaced women and girls, as well as to inform improved policymaking. These measures could not only enable women and girls to overcome challenges associated with displacement, but also provide them with ways to benefit from it.\n                </p>\n",
