In general, the sex ratio at birth tends to be in favour of men but turns in favour of women in later years of life.

For the world as a whole, there were more men than women of all ages: 101 men for every 100 women in 2000, and an estimated 102 men for every 100 women in 2020,<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> meaning that men outnumber women and that the difference between the two is getting slightly wider.

As of 2020, Europe has the largest deficit of men (93 men per 100 women), while the reverse is true in Western Asia (110 men per 100 women). During the period 2000\u20132020, the relative deficit of men was reduced in: Central Asia (from 97 to 98 men per 100 women); sub-Saharan Africa (from 99 to 100 men per 100 women); and Northern America (from 97 to 98 men per 100 women). In contrast, there was a significant increase in the surplus of men compared to women in Western Asia (from 103 to 110 men per 100 women). Within certain regions there are substantial variations by subregion: for example, there were 101 men per 100 women in Northern Africa compared to 110 men per 100 women in Western Asia.\n                </p>\n",

After that age, higher <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH11\">mortality rates</a> for men compared to women continue to be observed and the share of women increases rapidly. For example, in 2020, at the global level, the sex ratio was: 92 men per 100 women in the 65\u201369 age group; 70 men per 100 women in the 80\u201384 age group; and 47 men per 100 women in the 90\u201394 age group.</p>\n<p>During the period 2000\u20132020, the age at which women outnumber men has increased in most regions, from ages 15\u201319 to ages 30\u201334 in sub-Saharan Africa and from ages 60\u201364 to ages 65\u201369 in Central and Southern Asia. There was a decline, however, in the age at which women outnumber men in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (from ages 65\u201369 to ages 60\u201364), while the cross-over age remained unchanged for Europe and Northern America (ages 44\u201345).</p>\n<p>In general, the timing of the cross-over from a male surplus to a female surplus is related to multiple factors, including sex differentials by age in levels and patterns of mortality. On average, women live longer than men, and this is true for every country and plays an important role in how the sex ratio changes with age throughout adulthood. Differences in the ratios of men to women are linked to causes of death (<a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH10\">communicable diseases</a>, <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH9\">non-communicable diseases</a> and <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NH8\">external factors</a>), which vary depending on age, sex and geographical region. Possible explanations of the differences across regions in the age of the cross-over to a surplus of women over men include societal biases, which lead to inequalities faced by women at all stages of the life cycle, as well as large-scale migration, particularly labour migration of men compared to women in adult working ages. The latter may explain the demographic profile for Northern Africa and Western Asia, which is characterized by a much higher number of men than women in adult working ages, peaking to unusually high levels in the 30\u201334 age group.</p>\n",

In some populations, the sex ratio in favour of boys at birth exceeds the standard values. Sex-selective abortion, reflective of long-standing cultural preferences for sons, is a major explanatory factor.<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span></p>\n<p>While the sex ratio at birth has remained unchanged and close to the global average for most regions and countries, there are some significant differences. For example, in the Eastern and South-Eastern Asia region, this ratio increased from 109 boys per 100 girls in 1990\u20131995 to 112 boys per 100 girls in 2005\u20132010 and stands at 110 boys per 100 girls for the period 2015\u20132020. Similarly, in Central and Southern Asia, the sex ratio at birth was 109 male births per 100 female births in 1990\u20131995, peaking at 110 boys per 100 girls between 1995\u20132005, and has remained at 109 boys per 100 girls from 2005 \u20132020. These two regions include countries that currently have the highest ratios of male to female babies during the period 2015\u20132020 (see figure III): <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"China\">China</span> (113: 100), <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"India\">India</span> (110: 100), <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"Viet Nam\">Viet Nam</span> (112: 100) and Pakistan (109: 100). Countries in other regions that have shown a substantial change in the sex ratio at birth over this period include Albania, <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"Armenia\">Armenia</span>, <span class=\"label-ref\" tag=\"Azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</span> and Serbia, where the ratio is reported at ranges from 107 to 113 male babies per 100 female babies, indicating that more parents are selecting the sex of their offspring in favour of sons. </p>\n",

At the global level and for most regions, the population has transitioned to an older age structure, particularly for the female population (see figure IV).

The <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NP20\">older population</a> is clearly dominated by women in 2020: at the global level, the sex ratio is 92 men per 100 women in the 65\u201369 age group; 70 men per 100 women in the 80\u201384 age group; and 47 men per 100 women in the 90\u201394 age group.</p>\n<p>In all regions, except sub-Saharan Africa, populations show evidence of a shift towards an older age structure for both sexes between 2000\u20132020.
