The smallest gender gap in households with small children was recorded in Vidzeme and Riga, the capital of Latvia, while the largest gap was observed in Kurzeme (27.8 percentage points). The gap in households with older or no children remained small in Riga (the employment rate of women was higher than that of men), and the largest gap was registered in Zemgale (10.8 percentage points, with the employment rate of women higher than that of men). However, with respect to households with children under age 6, the Zemgale region showed the second largest gender employment gap in the country, with an employment rate of men 22.8 percentage points higher than women\u2019s (similar to the trend observed since 2010) (see figure VI).</p>\n",
