The variables presented are drawn from statistical sources available for many countries, including statistical business registers, foreign affiliate statistics, international trade statistics, structural business statistics and combined employer-employee datasets (see figure I).\nMerging data from official statistical datasets and registers enables the enrichment of gender analyses with economic aspects. Assessing gender equality, such as the gender pay gap, in the business sector is facilitated by the availability of indicators disaggregated by firm type and trading status. While most governments are committed to developing a gender-responsive trade policy, effective measures require country-specific indicators3 in order to obtain a full understanding of gender inequalities in trade.\n",

Thus, women in Finland are less likely to be able to fully benefit from economic globalization. Overall, only some 30% of the workforce in two-way trading enterprises are women, compared to 40% in non-trading enterprises. \nWhen merged, data also show that the gender pay gap in Finland tends to be larger in high-paying jobs provided by foreign multinationals and enterprises that trade internationally. Independent firms and those belonging to domestic groups provide more equal pay.9\nMore specifically, the largest gender pay gaps are found in multinational firms situated in knowledge intensive services compared to independent firms, domestic groups, domestic multinationals and foreign multinationals in three industries: manufacturing, knowledge intensive services and other activities. Data on the wages of women in these industries can help to direct policy attention and measures to address the largest gender pay gaps.\n",
