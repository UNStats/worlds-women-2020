Moreover, significant gender biases were reported in both upper and higher secondary education, with women often restricted to so-called feminine fields of study. \nIn response, the National Programme for Women 1995\u20142000 proposed \u201cto guarantee the access and enrolment of women at all levels and modalities of the education system\u201d, with priority given to ensuring the equality of educational opportunities at all levels of the school system, as well as reducing inequalities between women and men regarding access to school and educational outcomes.6 \n",

Socioeconomic status as well as place of residence have a significant effect on school enrolment and participation. In particular, in locations with limited physical access to upper and upper middle level schools, students with access to the Internet and advanced information and communication technologies (ICT) are able to access education by different modalities,9 and students at lower socioeconomic strata, without such access, are left at a disadvantage. \nEvidence shows that, in 2019, the attendance rate of both young women and men increases with their socioeconomic level, with young women and men aged 15\u201424 in upper socioeconomic strata attending school at relatively higher rates than their less advantaged counterparts. This applies regardless of urban or rural residence or age group (15-19 or 20-24). Young women and men aged 15\u201419 in upper socioeconomic strata living in rural areas had higher levels of attendance than their urban counterparts, and the same was observed for young women aged 20\u201424.\n",
