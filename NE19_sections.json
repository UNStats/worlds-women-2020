Those figures were only slightly higher than the corresponding figures for 2010. Participation in adult education and training varied considerably across countries. Sweden had the highest participation rate (43% of women and 26% of men), while in Romania only about 1% of women and men were engaged in adult education. In most countries, women were more likely to participate in learning activities than men, with the exception of Germany, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Romania and Switzerland, although the sex differential in participation rates in those countries was small.\n",

For those who had attained lower secondary level at most, the participation rate was below 5% for both women and men. There are a number of reasons for this situation, including, in particular, that the demand for training might be higher among individuals with higher levels of education because they already have the skills that facilitate learning and are more likely to be in jobs that demand ongoing training. Regardless of the educational level, in most countries, women\u2019s participation rates were higher than those of men. Gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation rates were significant among individuals with tertiary education. At lower educational attainment levels, gaps in participation in adult education between women and men were smaller or insignificant.\n",
