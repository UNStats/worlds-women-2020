Three conventions on maternity protection have been adopted by ILO, in 1919, 1952 and 2000: the most recent, the Maternity Protection Convention (Convention No. 183), stipulates that women should be entitled to no less than 14 weeks of maternity leave, with paid cash benefits amounting to at least two thirds of their normal earnings.3\n",

Almost all countries in developed regions have also followed the recommendation in Convention No. 183, with the exception of Iceland (13 weeks) and the United States of America (12 weeks). Entitlement to maternity leave has been increased up to 52 weeks in five countries in Europe,4 and up to 59 weeks in Croatia, since the adoption of the Maternity Protection Convention in 2000. It should be noted that in these countries, women\u2019s labour force participation has grown in recent years, contrary to the global trend. In contrast, less than a quarter of countries with available data in Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), South-Eastern Asia (20%), Southern Asia (14%) and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0%) offer 14 weeks or more of maternity leave (see figure I).

Paternity leave is a short period of leave for the father following the arrival of his child(ren), with the objective of encouraging fathers to assist in childcare and to attend to other family-related responsibilities. Paternity leave has become more common: in 2020, among 188 United Nations Member States and territories with available data worldwide, 103 countries (55%) had provisions on paternity leave, up from the 30 countries (16%) that provided such leave in 1995 (see figure III).\nIn 2020 in developed regions, new fathers are not entitled to paid paternity leave in Austria, Belarus, Switzerland, Israel, Montenegro, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia and Ukraine. Twenty-six countries in sub-Saharan Africa and 17 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean do not mandate paid time off for new fathers. In 2020, the median length of paid paternity leave worldwide was five days, similar to the corresponding figures observed in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (3 days) and Latin America and the Caribbean (5 days), a low number when compared with the 56 days of paternity leave provided in some high income States members of OECD.6 The European Union work-life balance directive, which entered into force as of 1 August 2019, extends the length of paternity leave in EU member states to at least 10 working days.7\nPaternity leave also has significant positive effects on women\u2019s employment, with an estimated increase of almost 7% in the proportion of women employed in private firms in developing regions when paternity leave is mandated.8\n",

As of 2017, paternity leave for United Nations staff was provided for a total period of up to 20 working days, or up to 40 working days for internationally recruited staff members serving at a non-family duty station or in exceptional circumstances (ST/AI/2005/2 and Amendments 1 and 2).
