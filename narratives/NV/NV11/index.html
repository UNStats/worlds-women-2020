                <li>Women still account for a small percentage of police officers. Between 2004 and 2017, the share of women police officers worldwide increased from 10.1% to 12.9%.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Women play a vital role in policing and contribute, as much as their male colleagues, to providing safe and inclusive communities. Female police officers act as role models for gender equality, inspiring women and girls to advocate for their own rights and to pursue careers in law enforcement. Moreover, female police officers provide a greater sense of security to women and children and improve access and support from law enforcement agencies to all members of the community.</p>
            <p>Women police officers utilize a style of policing that relies less on physical force, are better at defusing potentially violent confrontations,are less likely to become involved in the use of excessive force and are more likely to respond effectively to violence against women. <span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

            <h1>Current situation</h1>
            <p>There has been a slow evolution in the gender composition of police forces around the world towards the inclusion of female officers: globally the share of women police officers increased from 10.1% in 2004 to 12.9% in 2017 (see figure I).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV11_05">
            <p>Since the beginning of the century, the percentage of women police officers has increased globally (see figure II). In 2017, the largest percentage of women police officers was reported in <span class="label-ref" tag="Australia and New Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</span> (31.5%), followed by countries in the Europe and North America (17.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (15.7%), Sub-Saharan Africa (17.0%), Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (10.4%), Central and Southern Asia (6.7%) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span> regions (4.1%).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV11_06">
            <p> Based on the latest available data, in 2017 in five European countries the share of women police officer was greater than 30% (Estonia, <span class="label-ref" tag="Latvia">Latvia</span>, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden). Although the proportion of women police officers in those countries is higher than in other countries, there are still challenges in ensuring that women are represented at higher levels of management. The Nordic-Baltic Network of Policewomen continues to ask the question: why are women underrepresented in the top and middle management positions and in operational positions in the police force?<span class="footnote-index">2</span> </p>

        <section id="NV11_07">
            <p>The United Nations Department of Safety and Security has made increased efforts to mainstream gender into its policies and programmes, working with the partners of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network to develop and improve gender sensitivity and responsiveness in all aspects of the United Nations Security Management System and its security risk management processes.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> </p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV11_08">
            <p>As a result of these efforts, the number of female police officers deployed with the United Nations increased from about 900 (7% of 12,000 police) in 2009 to 1,300 officers (10% of 13,000) in 2016. More needs to be done, however, to address the gender imbalance, as .reaffirmed by the Security Council in its resolution 2242 (2015), in which it mandated that the Organization double the numbers of women in military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping operations by 2020.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> </p>
