                <li>Worldwide, 7% of women have experienced sexual violence by a non-partner “in their lifetime”.</li>

                <li>Most sexual violence is perpetrated by a person known by the victim. While 49% of women who have experienced sexual violence since age 15 reported that the perpetrator was their current husband or partner, 6% reported that the perpetrator was a stranger. Friends or acquaintances were the perpetrators 5% of the time.</li>

                <li>In 14 out of 46 countries with data, between 1% and 5% of women aged 20-29 reported experiencing sexual violence perpetrated by a non-partner since age 15. In the remaining countries the rate was less than 1%.</li>

                <li>International estimates on non-partner violence “in the previous 12 months” are being produced for the first time. Recent national estimates point to a risk of sexual violence by non-partners as being between 0.1 and 3.1%.</li>

            <h2>Lifetime prevalence</h2>

            <p>Sexual violence can be perpetrated by <a href=#NV1 class="narrative-ref">women’s intimate partners</a> or by others. According to WHO estimates in 2013,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> worldwide, 7.2% of women have experienced sexual violence by a non-partner in their lifetime.</p>

            <p>The majority of sexual violence is committed by intimate partners or someone known to the victim (see figure I). Based on data between 2005 and 2018, of those women who were subjected to sexual violence during their lifetime, almost half (48.6%) were victims of their current husband or partner; almost a quarter (24.2%) experienced violence at the hands of a former husband or partner; and an additional 8.2% were victims of their current or former boyfriend. <strong>This suggests that for 8 out of 10 women subjected to sexual violence, the perpetrator is a current or former intimate partner or boyfriend.</strong></p>



        </section>

        <section id="NV2_04">
            <p><strong>Over 90%<span class="footnote-index">2</span> of women subjected to sexual violence knew the perpetrator (see figure I)</strong>, including 5.3% who reported that the perpetrator was a friend or acquaintance (1 in every 19 victims). Conversely, around 10% of women subjected to sexual violence did not know the perpetrator, including 6.3% (or 1 in every 16 victims of sexual violence) who reported that the perpetrator was a stranger.</p>

            <p>Even after excluding current and former intimate partners from the analysis, the majority of women subjected to sexual violence knew their perpetrator. At least 62%<span class="footnote-index">3</span> of non-partner sexual violence is committed by a person known to the victim, while 23%<span class="footnote-index">4</span> of sexual violence is committed by a complete stranger.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV2_05">
            <h2>Prevalence in the past 12 months in selected countries</h2>

            <p>In reporting on sexual violence in the previous 12 months in eight countries in Eastern and South Eastern Europe participating in the 2019 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE-led Survey on Violence against Women,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> 0.8% of women reported sexual violence by a non-partner during the previous 12 months. Country estimates ranged from 0.1% in North Macedonia to 1.0% in Ukraine.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
            <p>In general, data availability on sexual violence is higher for studies on intimate partner violence. However, in recent years, several national statistical offices<span class="footnote-index">7</span> have conducted surveys of violence against women and produced estimated rates of sexual violence perpetrated by non-partners. For example, results from a personal safety survey carried out in Australia in 2016 found that 1.8% of women had experienced sexual violence by a non-partner in the past 12 months, and the 2017 national study on gender-based violence in Mongolia pointed to a proportion of 3.1%.</p>

        <section id="NV2_06">

            <p><span class="label-ref" tag="youth">Younger women</span> face a greater risk of sexual assault. According to data from justice systems and rape crisis centres in Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru and the United States of America, the incidence of certain forms of sexual violence is closely associated with the age of the victim, in particular violence taking place in schools and colleges.<span class="footnote-index">8</span> The proportion of women aged 20–29 who have ever experienced sexual violence by a non-partner since age 15 is an important indicator of non-partner sexual violence.</p>

            <p>In the 46 countries for which data are available (see figure II), the proportion of women aged 20–29 who have experienced sexual violence perpetrated by someone other than an intimate partner since age 15 ranged from less than 1% in Tajikistan (2014) and Kyrgyzstan (2015) to 4.8% in <span class="label-ref" tag="Colombia">Colombia</span> (2016).</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV2_07">
            <h2>Data availability and measurement challenges</h2>

            <p>The availability of data on sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner is much lower than that for intimate partner violence.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in data collection surveys have relied on different methodologies, used different definitions of sexual violence, formulated different questions and sampled diverse age groups. In addition, willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to cultural context, a factor that can affect reported prevalence levels and the overall comparability of international data.</p>

            <p>A further challenge is the formulation of the time frame of “previous 12 months” in SDG indicator 5.2.2. This is a problem for two reasons: firstly, far fewer countries have measured non-partner sexual violence in the preceding 12 months compared with sexual violence over the lifetime; secondly, in surveys it is often reported that the rate of past-year sexual violence for an aggregate age group of women aged 15 and older is close to zero. This very low point estimate of prevalence makes the assessment of changes over time difficult, particularly when data are presented disaggregated by age.</p>

            <p>These factors make monitoring trends at the country, regional and international levels difficult.
                Efforts are ongoing to develop international estimates of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.</p>
