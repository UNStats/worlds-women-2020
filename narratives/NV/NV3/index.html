                <li>In more than 1 in 4 countries with data, at least 5% of young women aged 18–29 reported experiences of sexual violence in childhood.</li>

                <li>While children of both sexes can be the target of sexual violence, girls are at a heightened risk. Girls are 4 to 5 times more likely than boys to experience sexual violence.</li>

                <li>There is a strong correlation between childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse after age 15, which may suggest that among children, adolescent girls are at higher risk of experiencing sexual violence.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Experiences of sexual violence in childhood hinder all aspects of development, physical, psychological/emotional and social. Apart from the physical injuries that can result from sexual violence, researchers have consistently found that sexual abuse of children is associated with a wide array of mental health consequences and adverse behavioural outcomes in adulthood.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> The psychological impact of sexual violence can be severe due to the intense shame, secrecy and stigma that tend to accompany it.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

        <section id="NV3_04">
            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>Sexual violence against children, which occurs in all countries at all levels of income and development, can affect children at all ages and in different settings. While both sexes can be victimized, data suggest that girls are generally at heightened risk, although there is a lack of data documenting the experiences of sexual violence among boys. The absence of such data may have led to the erroneous perception that boys are relatively immune from this form of violence.</p>

            <p>In slightly more than 1 in 4 countries with available data at least 5% of women aged 18–29 reported experiencing sexual violence in childhood. In five countries (Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Sweden and Trinidad and Tobago), more than 10% of women reported experiencing sexual violence during childhood.</p>

            <p>Comparable data on sexual violence in childhood among men aged 18–29 are available for only 11 countries, and figures are lower than those reported among women in 10 of those countries, with reported rates of sexual violence perpetrated against boys under 18 years old, on average, between 4 and 5 times lower than that experienced by girls under 18 (see figure I). Care should be used when interpreting these gender differences due to the differing types of stigma faced by young women and men when reporting childhood sexual violence.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>

            <p>Regional averages for the proportion of young women aged 18–29 who experienced sexual violence by age 18 are available only for countries in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> and Central and Southern Asia: data show a higher prevalence of sexual violence against young women in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates are also available for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries (see figure II).<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Based on data collected up to 2017, the global estimate of sexual violence against girls is 2.7%,<span class="footnote-index">5</span><span class="footnote-index">5</span> although great care should be taken when interpreting this figure as there are significant data gaps for countries in many regions of the world.</p>

            <h2>There is a correlation between the rates of childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse among young women</h2>
            <p>There is a strong correlation between the proportion of women aged 18-29 who have experienced sexual violence by age 18 (SDG indicator 16.2.3) and the proportion of women aged 20 – 29 who have experienced sexual abuse since age 15. While there is some overlap between the age groups used in these two indicators,<span class="footnote-index">6</span> the correlation suggests that in countries where there is a higher risk of childhood sexual abuse, young women also face an increased risk of sexual abuse after the age of 15. In addition, the correlation suggests that girls aged 15–18 are more likely to be victims of childhood sexual abuse than during earlier stages of childhood, thus confirming that the highest risk of sexual abuse is among adolescents. Figure III shows this correlation among the 43 countries with data for both indicators.</p>

            <p>Although children of every age can be affected, adolescence is a period of pronounced vulnerability, especially for girls.</p>
