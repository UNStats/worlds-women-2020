            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Female genital mutilation is a violation of the human rights of girls and women that affects girls and women worldwide. There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of female genital mutilation over both the short and long term: the practice is a direct manifestation of gender inequality, which “constitutes irreparable, irreversible harm and is an act of violence against women and girls”.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
            <p>While the practice is most concentrated in countries in Africa, from the Atlantic coast across to the Horn of Africa, it is also practiced in countries in the Middle East, such as Iraq and Yemen, in some countries in Asia, and also in some communities in Australia, Europe and Northern America.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV5_04">
            <p>Female genital mutilation is condemned in international treaties and conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and the Cairo Declaration for the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, since FGM is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In many countries national legislation includes an explicit ban on the practice.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV5_05">
            <p>With its inclusion under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 5.3, which is aimed at the elimination of this harmful practice by 2030, FGM holds a prominent position on the global development agenda. Although the practice has persisted for centuries, it is becoming less common, with a marked decline reported in countries such as Egypt where it was once universal, as well as in countries such as Kenya, where the practice is restricted to specific ethnic communities.</p>
            <p>Such declines at the country level have contributed to a reduction in regional rates over the past 15 years. In <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa</span>, the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15–19 years who have undergone FGM or cutting decreased by 17.5%, from 91.4% in 2004 to 73.9% in 2019. In <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span>, its prevalence decreased by 9.6%, from 34.5% to 24.9%, over the same time period (see figure I).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV5_06">
            <p> Prevalence rates of FGM vary significantly by country. The latest available data on the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-49 years who have undergone FGM or cutting are shown by country in figure II, which highlights the fact that, despite recent progress, the prevalence of FGM remains alarmingly high in parts of Northern Africa and West Africa.<span class="footnote-index">8</span> Moreover, the onset of <span class="label-ref" tag="Covid-19">Covid-19</span> has interrupted programmes to end FGM, which could threaten progress towards the elimination of the practice. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV5_07">
            <p>Figure III shows data for the 18 countries with a decline in the percentage of adolescent girls who have undergone FGM over the course of the past 30 years (1990–2020).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV5_08">
            <p>Figure IV highlights the seven countries where the prevalence of FGM either remains persistently high or where no significant decline has been observed over the same time period.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="NV5_09">
            <p>Progress has been extremely slow in Guinea and Somalia, where the practice remains almost universal and where at least 9 in 10 women and adolescent girls aged 15–19 years have been cut. Based on the latest available data, in six countries<span class="footnote-index">9</span> at least 3 out of every 4 women and adolescent girls aged 15–19 have undergone FGM, including in the Gambia where, worryingly, the prevalence of this harmful practice has increased compared with 30 years ago. </p>
            <p> Progress in the elimination of FGM is not universal, and where there is progress it is not fast enough. Even in countries where the practice has become less common, progress would need to be at least 10 times faster to meet the global target of its elimination by 2030.<span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>

            <h1>Legislative environment</h1>
            <p>FGM is widely condemned in both international treaties and conventions as well as under national legislation in many countries. </p>

            <h1>Vulnerable groups</h1>
            <p>The risk faced by women and adolescent girls aged 15–19 of undergoing FGM is highly dependent on context, with ethnicity playing a particularly strong role in determining whether they will be cut.<span class="footnote-index">11</span></p>

            <h1>Country in focus</h1>
            <p>In Kenya, where the practice has been banned under law since 2011, 4 in 10 women and adolescent girls have undergone FGM, although the variation across ethnic groups is dramatic; the practice is still prevalent among some <span class="label-ref" tag="ethnicity">ethnicities</span> (for example, among the Somali population, where it is estimated to be 94%), but almost non-existent among others (including both the Luhya and Luo ethnicities, where it is less than 1%).</p>
