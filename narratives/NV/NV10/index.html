            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The entry of women judges into judiciary positions from which they have historically been excluded has been a positive step in ensuring that judiciaries are perceived as being more inclusive and representative of the people whose lives they serve and affect. By their mere presence, women judges enhance the legitimacy of courts, sending a powerful signal that they are open and accessible to those who seek recourse to justice.</p>
            <p>Women judges contribute much more than improving gender balance within the judiciary, they also contribute significantly to the quality of decision-making, and thus to the quality of justice itself.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>Data on judges and magistrates are collected in the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, which is issued every second year by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Over the past decade, the proportion of women judges or magistrates has increased steadily year after year, at an average of approximately half a percentage point (0.54%). In 2017, the share of women judges was estimated to be 40%, up from 35% in 2008 (figure I). If recent trends continue, the share of female judges will reach parity (50%) by 2035.</p>

        <section id="NV10_05">
            <p>As evidenced from data at the regional level, there is a significant variation in the share of women professional judges or magistrates in different parts of the world (figure II), although the overall share of women judges and magistrates increased in all regions during the period from 2008 to 2017.</p>

        <section id="NV10_06">
            <p> Based on available data up to 2017, the region with the largest percentage of women judges is Europe and Northern America (57%), largely owing to the fact that the proportion of women in the judiciary in countries in <span class="label-ref" tag="Eastern and Southern Europe">Eastern and Southern Europe</span> has already reached and/or surpassed parity in 16 out of 21 countries.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> </p>

        <section id="NV10_07">
            <p>In Latin America and the Caribbean, women make up 43% of the judiciary, followed by 40% in sub-Saharan Africa, 40% in Central and Southern Asia, 40% in Northern Africa and Western Asia, 34% in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and 32% in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
            <p>In its 2015 report on gender equality, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, while acknowledging the general lack of quantitative data for countries in the Pacific, reported that in some countries in <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span>, excluding Australia and New Zealand, less than 5% of judges are women.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> </p>
