            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Violence against women and girls is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and Intimate partner violence, is the most common form of violence faced by women and girls worldwide. One in three women will experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in her life.<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">1</a></span> Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary and/or normal element of relationships, particularly in the context of marriage or other unions.</p>

            <p>Based on the latest available data for 112 countries during the period from 2005 to 2018, it is estimated that, worldwide, 18% of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15&ndash;49 have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence during the previous 12 months. Based on data from 112 countries, 14% of women have experienced physical violence and 6% of women have experienced sexual violence at the hands of intimate partners during the previous 12 months. As shown in figure I, this proportion varies widely across regions and countries.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV1_04">
            <p>Regional differences in the rates of intimate partner violence persist, with women in the Pacific, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa regions at greatest risk. In <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span>, excluding Australia and New Zealand, the 12-month prevalence rate for intimate partner violence was 35%. The rates of intimate partner violence in <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span> (23%) and <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (22%) were above the global average. In contrast, the prevalence rate of recent intimate partner violence is lower, although significant, in Latin America and the Caribbean, at an average of 12%, and lower still in Europe, where the 12-month prevalence rate is 6%.</p>

            <p>Focusing on <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span>, population-based evidence confirms that intimate partner violence against women remains a widespread public health and human rights problem, with a reported prevalence of physical or sexual intimate partner violence during the previous 12 months across countries ranging from 3% to 27% of women and girls.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV1_05">
            <p>A survey carried out in Europe in 2019, led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and covering seven countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, found that 6.7%<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">2</a></span> of women had been subjected to physical or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Prevalence rates over the 12-month period ranged from 3.1% in Republic of North Macedonia to 9.4% in the Republic of Moldova.</p>
            <p>Although many countries collect information on violence against women, direct comparisons are difficult to make because of differences in data collection methodology.<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">3</a></span> In particular, some developed countries regularly publish statistics on intimate partner violence based on victimization surveys and complement these statistics with the number of cases reported to the police in order to measure prevalence of violence as well as coverage of reported cases.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV1_06">
            <p>Since 2010, among countries with comparable data (47 countries),<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">4</a></span> the proportion of women and girls experiencing intimate partner physical or sexual violence in the past 12 months ranged from 3.5% in Armenia (2015&ndash;2016) to 46.1% in Afghanistan (2015).</p>
            <p>Some issues with comparability persist owing to historical data related to age ranges used in different surveys. Putting these differences to one side, available data for the 112 countries up to 2018 show that the proportion of women experiencing intimate partner physical or sexual violence in the past 12 months ranged from 2.0% in Spain (2012) and Slovenia (2012) to a rate of 46.1% in Afghanistan (2015).</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV1_07">
            <p> Survey data from 63 countries indicate that the prevalence of intimate partner violence generally decreases with age. Based on available data disaggregated by 5-year-age groups, <span class="label-ref" tag="youth">younger women</span> (aged 15–19, 20–24 and 25–29) are at the greatest risk of experiencing intimate partner violence, although rates of intimate partner violence by broad age group vary widely across countries (see figure II).</p>
            <p>Between 2005 and 2017, 36 countries conducted more than one survey to measure the prevalence of intimate partner violence in the 12 months prior to the survey. Evidence of the magnitude of change in the level of intimate partner violence is mixed, with 21 countries (58%) recording decreases in intimate partner violence and 10 countries (28%) recording increases. The trend was unclear in five countries (14%). </p>

                Laws on domestic violence
            </h1>
            <p> As of 2020, at least 153 countries have passed laws on domestic violence. Developed countries, including countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Oceania, have the highest coverage, with over 90% of countries in these regions having laws on domestic violence: this stands in stark contrast to the situation in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Northern and Western Asia, less than 65% of which have specifically criminalized domestic violence.</p>

            <h1>Vulnerable groups</h1>
            <p>Rates of domestic violence against <span class="label-ref" tag="indigenous">indigenous women</span> are often significantly higher than the rest of the population. Surveys to measure violence against women must include these populations in order to ensure no one is left behind. In 2016, in analysis carried out by the Domestic Violence Resource Centre in the Australian state of Victoria<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">5</a></span> it was reported that Aboriginal women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalized from family violence<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">6</a></span> and almost 11 times more likely to be <a class="narrative-ref" href="#NV7" target="_blank">killed</a> as a result of violent assault.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NV1_10">
            <p><span class="label-ref" tag="older persons">Older women</span> are also at risk of family violence<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">7</a></span> and are often not included in the population covered by surveys on the topic. One country that reports on violence against senior women is Canada, where risk of being the victim of a violent crime generally decreases with age. As a reflection of this overall pattern, seniors had the lowest rates of police-reported violent crime, regardless of whether violence was perpetrated by a family member or someone outside the family network. However, senior victims of family violence are more likely to sustain injuries than other victims of family violence.<span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">8</a></span> The Canadian data suggest that, as women age, they are at greater risk of experiencing violence at the hands of their grown children while still at risk of violence from their domestic partners. In 2010, 36% of perpetrators of violence against seniors aged 65&ndash;69 were their grown children, followed by their spouses (30%).</p>
            <p>Data on the prevalence of violence against women and girls is often lacking for women and girls with disabilities, ethnic minorities, migrant workers and older women. Even where such data exist, comparability between countries and within countries remains challenging.</p>

            <h1>Countries in focus</h1>
            <p>Intimate partner violence is often unreported. In <a href=#NV10 class="narrative-ref">Kazakhstan</a>, 51% of women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have never shared the information with anyone.</p>
            <p>Based on data from 2016, intimate partner violence in <a href=#NV11 class="narrative-ref">Mexico</a> remains a significant issue, with almost one out of four women 15 and older (23.9%) reporting having experienced violence in the previous 12 months (a slight reduction from 24.7% in 2011).</p>

                <p>Women and girls aged 15&ndash;49.</p>
                <h2>Availability</h2>
                <p>Data on the proportion of women and girls who have experienced physical or sexual violence in the previous 12 months (2005&ndash;2018) is available for 112 countries (31 developed countries and 81 developing countries), including 36 countries with multiple data points, allowing for trend analysis.</p>

                    <li><span class="definition">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 5.2.1.</span><span class="footnote-index"><a data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">9</a></span> measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls who have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. While physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally well defined and measured, this is not the case with psychological partner violence, which may be conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts. Therefore, this indicator currently reports on the global level of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. A majority of data come from demographic and health surveys, which typically sample only women and girls aged 15-49. There is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across country surveys: in the case of surveys that interview a sample of women and girls from a different age group, the prevalence for data on the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports violence experienced by ever-partnered women and girls 15-49 years of age.</li>
                    <li><span class="definition">Physical violence</span> consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose and/or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife.</li>
                    <li><span class="definition">Sexual violence</span> is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest and/or sexual harassment. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman or girl considers humiliating or degrading.</li>
