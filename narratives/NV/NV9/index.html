            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p> Not all countries have laws criminalizing or containing provisions on violence against women, and when such laws are in place, authorities are often more focused on responding to cases of domestic violence through criminal justice processes rather than on ways of preventing its occurrence by providing support and resources to women at risk of abuse. Furthermore, even when domestic violence laws exist, they are not necessarily implemented, or implemented in a form that helps the victims in substantive ways.</p>
            <p>In many cases, victims of domestic violence are economically dependent on their intimate partners and the conviction and/or imprisonment of perpetrators often leaves victims deprived of their one source of economic support. In the light of these factors, domestic violence laws need to be implemented in tandem with measures for the economic empowerment of women, including, in particular, appropriate social support mechanisms for those who take the difficult step of seeking legal recourse.</p>

            <h1>Laws on domestic violence</h1>
            <p>As of 2020, at least 153 countries have passed laws on <a href=#NV1 class="narrative-ref">domestic violence</a>, 106 have laws on sexual harassment and 45 have laws on marital rape.

            <h1>Laws on sexual harassment</h1>
            <p>As of 2020, 106 countries have passed laws on sexual harassment, and the regional distribution is broadly similar to that observed with respect to laws on domestic violence (see figure II). However, there is one noticeable difference: in the <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> region, while the majority of countries have laws on domestic violence (97%), far fewer have laws on sexual harassment (64%). </p>

        <section id="NV9_06">
            <p>In many parts of the world legislation does not adequately protect women from marital rape. As of 2020, only 45 countries have adopted laws on marital rape; only 46% of developed countries have laws on marital rape; and fewer than 14% of developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southern Asia, Northern Africa and Western Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) have such laws (figure III).</p>

                    <li id="fn3">In general, while rape laws (except where the exemption of a spouse is explicitly stated) do not preclude a spouse from being prosecuted, data refer to instances where laws explicitly criminalize marital rape without qualifications, for example, by providing that sexual assault provisions apply irrespective of the nature of the relationship between the perpetrator and complainant, or that no marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defense against a charge of sexual assault under the law. In other instances, a marital (or equivalent) relationship may be explicitly cited in the law as an aggravating factor. Explicit criminalization of marital rape is recommended as best practice by, among other bodies, the Council of Europe. (⇡ back to text</a>) </li>
