            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Trained, qualified and well-motivated teachers are essential for an effective learning environment and quality education (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4). Teaching staff has an important role in the creation of a gender-sensitive learning and social environment in which young women and men are treated equally and encouraged to achieve their full potential. Gender balance among teaching staff is critical for promoting gender parity and equality in access to, and achievement in, education and for creating a supportive and non-discriminatory learning environment. There is evidence that gender balance among teaching staff is closely related to the improvement of gender parity in school enrolment.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> Policies that promote gender balance in the teaching workforce have been found to have a positive impact on access to education and completion rates, especially for girls and young women.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

            <p><strong>More men than women teach at the tertiary level</strong></p>
            <p>Globally, female teachers constituted 43% of tertiary-level teaching staff in 2018 (see figure I). Across the world, however, the proportions of female teachers at the tertiary level showed a wide range of variation: the highest level in <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia">Central Asia</span> (54%) and lowest in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (24%).</p>

            <p><strong>Data show that the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level has increased in all regions of the world</strong></p>
            <p>The participation of women in teaching at the tertiary level has increased in all regions of the world (see figure I). The global share of female teachers at the tertiary level increased from 33% to 43% over the period 1990–2018. In many regions, the proportion of female teachers grew by double digits: in South-Eastern Asia by 21 percentage points; in Southern Asia by 15 percentage points, in Northern America by 14 percentage points, and in Eastern Asia by 13 percentage points. The gains were modest (less than 10 percentage points) in sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and Western Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. During the period 1990–2018, <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia">Central Asia</span> was the only region to attain gender parity among teachers at the tertiary level of education.</p>

            <p><strong>Most of the countries with less than 30% of female teachers at the tertiary level of education were in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span></strong></p>
            <p>In 46 countries out of 150 (about 30%) reporting data for the period 2010–2019, the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level was in the range of 45% to 55%, indicating the achievement of gender parity in the teaching force. In 15 countries, more that 55% of teachers at the tertiary level were women, and in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar the proportion of female teachers was higher than 60% (see figure II). </p>
            <p>In contrast, in 89 countries (60% of countries with data) the share of female teachers at the tertiary level was less than 45%. Low proportions of female teachers at the tertiary level (below 30%) were reported in 36 countries, 28 of which were in @@sub-Saharan Africa@@. The other countries with a low representation of female teachers were in Northern Africa and Western Asia (Jordan, Morocco and the State of Palestine), Southern Asia (Afghanistan and Bangladesh) and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (Cambodia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea). Data show, moreover, that the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level tends to be lower in countries with low levels of overall <a href=#NE10 class="narrative-ref">enrolment in tertiary education</a>.</p>

        <section id="NE16_07">
            <p>In most regions of the word, the majority of teachers at the primary level (about 66%) are women, although data reveal variations between countries. Women’s share in teaching drops significantly at higher levels of education: female teachers at the secondary level constitute slightly more than half of the teaching staff; and at the tertiary level, worldwide, the majority of teachers are men. Globally, the proportion of female teachers at the tertiary level of education was 43% in 2018.</p>
