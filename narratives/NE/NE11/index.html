            <h1>Gender parity index of gross enrolment ratios in primary education</h1>
            <p><strong>Gender parity in primary education has been reached globally, although regional disparities persist</strong></p>
            <p>The global GPI of gross enrolment ratios (GER) in primary education was 1.00 in 2018, implying that, at the global level, girls and boys were equally likely to participate in primary education. This global average masks disparities among regions, however (see figure I). As of 2018: (a) in Northern America and Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Northern Africa, Central Asia, Eastern Asia, South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean the GPI for each region was within the range of parity; (b) in sub-Saharan Africa (where the GPI was 0.96), <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0.93) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Western Asia</span> (0.94), the GPI value was lower than the range of parity; and (c) in <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span> the GPI fell outside the range of parity (1.07), meaning that girls were more likely than boys to participate in primary education.</p>

            <p><strong>Substantial progress towards gender parity occurred in those regions where boys had once vastly outnumbered girls in primary education</strong></p>
            <p>Since 1990, there has been a significant shift towards greater gender parity in primary education (see figure I). The global GPI of primary gross enrolment ratios rose from 0.88 in 1990 to 1.00 in 2018. GPI values improved substantially, particularly in <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa</span> (from 0.83 to 0.97), <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (from 0.83 to 0.96) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span> (from 0.75 to 1.07), all regions with the widest disparities in GPI in 1990. Remarkable gains were also registered in Eastern Asia over the period since 1990, with its regional GPI reaching a value of 1.00 in 2005, and parity has remained steady until the present time. Australia and New Zealand and countries in Northern America and Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and Central Asia and South-Eastern Asia maintained gender parity in primary education throughout the period 1990—2018.</p>

            <h2>Gender parity index of the gross enrolment ratios in secondary education</h2>
            <p><strong>The gender gap in secondary education has closed in most regions</strong></p>
            <p>The gender gap in the global gross enrolment ratios for girls and boys in <a href=#NE9 class="narrative-ref">secondary education</a> has narrowed steadily during the period 1990—2018. The GPI based on gross enrolment ratios in secondary education rose from a value of 0.84 in 1990 to 0.99 in 2018, confirming that the gender gap at the secondary level of education has closed at the global level (see figure II). </p>

        </section>

        <section id="NE11_06">
            <p>Despite the gains made over the past three decades, girls are still less likely than boys to enrol in secondary school in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (where GPI was 0.88 in 2018), Western Asia (0.90) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0.82), all regions with low overall enrolment ratios for both girls and boys. In <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span>, where the GPI was low in 1990 (0.59), the gender gap has been closed at the fastest rate over the period 1990—2018 (the GPI in 2018 was 1.00). In regions with higher overall secondary enrolment ratios, such as <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> (where the GPI was 1.04 in 2018), gender-based disparities favour girls. Northern America and Europe and Central Asia are the only regions that have achieved and maintained equal access to secondary education for both girls and boys throughout the period 1990—2018.</p>

            <p><strong>Gender disparities at the secondary level are wider than those at the primary level</strong></p>
            <p>Although gender disparities in access to secondary education have been reduced in all regions, they remain more prevalent and wider than those at the primary level (see figures I and II). In sub-Saharan Africa, the GPI at the primary level was 0.96 in 2018, whereas the GPI was 0.88 at the secondary level. Similarly, in Western Asia, the primary level GPI was 0.94 versus the secondary level GPI of 0.90. In those countries where girls are severely disadvantaged, gender differences at the secondary level are partly a reflection of cumulative gender disparities at the primary level as well as disparities during the transition to the secondary level.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

            <h2>Gender parity index of the gross enrolment ratios in tertiary education</h2>
            <p><strong>Gender disparities in tertiary education disproportionately favour women</strong></p>
            <p>During the period 1990—2018, gender disparities in <a href=#NE10 class="narrative-ref">tertiary education</a> shifted from a male to female advantage both in the world and in most regions (see figure III). In 1990, men’s participation in tertiary level education was higher than that of women, as reflected in a worldwide GPI of 0.89 (in sub-Saharan Africa the GPI was 0.47; in Southern Asia, 0.49; in Eastern Asia, 0.52; in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), 0.60; in Northern Africa, 0.68; and in Western Asia 0.70). </p>


        </section>

        <section id="NE11_09">
            <p>Overall, because the global participation of women has increased at a faster rate than that of men, the tertiary enrolment ratios of men and women reached parity in the late 1990s and remained at parity until the early 2000s. The global participation of women in tertiary education has since exceeded that of men, shifting gender disparity from a male to female advantage. In 2018, the GPI of the global tertiary enrolment of women and men stood at 1.14, reflecting a gender disparity clearly in favour of women.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NE11_10">
            <p>In most regions of the world, women outnumber men in tertiary education. In 2018, the GPI well surpassed the parity range in Northern America and Europe (GPI of 1.28), Australia and New Zealand (1.42), Northern Africa (1.17), Latin America and the Caribbean (1.30), Eastern Asia (1.16) and South-Eastern Asia (1.23). Nevertheless, a considerable disparity in favour of men persists in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (0.74)and <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0.84). Overall, there are almost as many women as men enrolled in tertiary education in Central Asia, Southern Asia and Western Asia, but the regional averages conceal a low participation rate among women in several countries within those regions.</p>
