            Girls outperform boys in reading proficiency in every region of the

            Girls performed better than boys in reading in all but one country
            (85 out of 86 countries) at the end of lower secondary education.
            Girls outperformance in reading skills is more pronounced at the end

            Large regional differences exist in minimum proficiency in reading
            skills; extremely low proficiency levels in reading were observed in
            the majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (proficiency level
            of less than 30% in grades 2 or 3 of primary education).

          <li>
            Proficiency in mathematics does not present significant gender
            disparities as opposed to reading skills, however, boys slightly
            outperform girls at the end of primary education and girls
            outperform boys at the end of lower secondary education.

            Gender disparity in student learning changes over young adulthood,
            and the gender gap in reading, at the advantage of girls, is almost
            completely closed at around age 30.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The main purpose of education is to impart skills to young people so
          that they can effectively participate in social, economic and
          political life. Ensuring that children are
          <a class="narrative-ref" href="#NE11" target="_blank">in school</a> is
          not an end in itself. Reading and mathematics are considered to be the
          most important, most basic, skills as they serve as the foundation for
          all other skills and are needed to obtain further education and
          training. People who cannot read, write and do basic arithmetic have
          fewer opportunities for gainful employment, entrepreneurial activity
          or civic participation.

      <section id="NE14_04">
        <p>
          Foundation skills are also essential for active citizenship and safe
          choices about personal health. A lack of basic knowledge in those two
          subject areas not only threatens an individual’s ability to climb out
          of poverty, it also jeopardizes the economic future of entire nations
          if they are obliged to compete in a global marketplace with
          less-than-skilled human resources.<span class="footnote-index"

          Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, indicator 4.1.1, measures the
          quality of student learning outcomes in two subject areas (mathematics
          and reading) in early and late primary education and at the end of
          lower secondary education.

        <p>
          Girls’ advantage in reading is well documented. Girls outperformed
          boys in reading proficiency in every region of the world and across
          all three levels of education—early and late primary education and at
          the end of lower secondary education (see figures I, II and III). This
          was the case in 64 out of 73 countries with data at the level of
          grades 2 or 3 of primary education, and this was also the case in 31
          out of 35 countries at the end of primary education. Girls performed
          better than boys in reading in all but one country (85 out of 86
          countries) at the end of lower
          <a href="#NE9" class="narrative-ref">secondary education</a>. These
          gaps underscore the importance of a gender-sensitive approach in
          teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gender gaps in reading proficiency, which generally favour girls, tend
          to be more pronounced at the end of lower secondary than at the other
          two lower levels of education. This is the case in both developing and
          developed countries.

          Large regional differences exist in minimum proficiency in reading.
          Extremely low proficiency levels in reading were observed in the
          majority of countries in
          <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa"
            >sub-Saharan Africa</span
          >, where more than 7 out of 10 countries with data show a proficiency
          level of less than 30% at grades 2 or 3 of primary education.
          Proficiency in reading for both girls and boys at that level of
          education was similarly low in many countries in Central and Southern
          Asia. Despite years of steady growth in enrolment rates, proficiency
          rates in these regions remain extremely low. In contrast, proficiency
          in reading for both girls and boys was high (above 90%) in Europe and
          Northern America and Australia and New Zealand, as well as in some
          countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. Proficiency in reading
          was moderate in the majority of the countries in Northern Africa and
          Western Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regional patterns of reading skills were similar for the other two
          levels of education (end of primary education and end of lower
          secondary education), although proficiency levels were more modest in
          comparison to those at grades 2 or 3 of primary education.

          Proficiency in mathematics presents a more mixed picture than reading.
          Proficiency in mathematics was also characterized by gender
          differences. However, in contrast to what was observed for reading
          skills, the gender gaps were not significant across educational levels
          and regions, with few exceptions (see figures I, II and III).

          Gender disparities pertaining to proficiency in mathematics display
          diverse patterns across educational levels. At the level of grades 2
          or 3 of primary education, boys outperformed girls in 33 out of 66
          countries with data, while in 31 countries girls did better. At the
          end of primary education, 29 out of 41 countries with data showed
          gender gaps in favour of boys, and in 11 countries, the gender
          disparity favoured girls. At the end of lower secondary education,
          only 43 out of 95 countries with data displayed gender disparities
          favouring boys; in 51 of the remaining countries girls slightly
          outperformed boys. Girls appear to be narrowing the gap in achievement
          in mathematics, an area where boys have historically held an
          advantage.

        <h2>Learning disparities change over young adulthood</h2>
        <p>
          Some studies<span class="footnote-index">2</span> show that the gender
          disparity in student learning changes over young adulthood. Young
          people’s literacy and numeracy skills continue to develop after
          primary and secondary education, reaching a peak at around age 30. The
          ways in which skills develop are influenced by the formative education
          and employment choices and paths young people pursue. In a comparison
          survey of students aged 15 carried out under the Programme for
          International Student Assessment, coordinated by the Organization for
          Economic and Cooperation and Development (OECD), followed by a
          Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
          survey 12 years later, significant changes in disparities were
          reported: wide literacy gaps between girls and boys narrowed or
          disappeared in young adulthood. At age 15, girls in OECD countries
          outperformed boys in reading, but by age 27, the gender gap had almost
          completely closed.<span class="footnote-index">3</span>

                The indicator is calculated as the percentage of children and

                exceeding a predefined minimum proficiency level in a given
                subject. The minimum proficiency level is defined as the
                benchmark of basic knowledge in a given domain (reading and
                mathematics) measured through learning assessments. Currently,
                there are no common standards for a global benchmark. Since each
                learning assessment sets its own objectives and standards, the
                performance levels defined in these assessments may not be
                consistent.
