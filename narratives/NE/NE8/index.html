                <li>Globally, women researchers constituted only 30% of all researchers.</li>

                <li>The share of women among researchers varies widely across regions, with the highest share of female researchers in countries the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Only three regions, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern Africa, and Central Asia, have achieved or almost attained gender parity, that is, a share of between 45% and 55% for either sex.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Outcomes from R&D play a pivotal role in transforming societies, economies and the natural environment. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> countries pledged to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation” (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9. Target 9.5 of SDG 9 called upon countries to enhance scientific research, upgrade technological capabilities, encourage innovation and substantially increase the number of researchers, as well as public and private spending on R&D. Achieving this target will not be possible without harnessing all talents and addressing gender imbalances in the research workforce.</p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p><strong>Women constituted only 30% of all researchers worldwide, with wide disparities among regions</strong></p>

            <p>Globally, women accounted for only 30% of total researchers in 2017 (see figure I). The share of women among researchers displayed wide variation across regions, with countries Latin America and the Caribbean having the highest share of women researchers (46% in 2017). The proportion of women researchers was also relatively high in Northern Africa (45%), Central Asia (45%) and South-Eastern Asia (41%). Around one in three researchers was female in Europe and Northern America (35%), Western Asia (33%) and sub-Saharan Africa (31%), exceeding the world average. In contrast, the share of women researchers was the lowest in <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span> (23%) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Eastern Asia">Eastern Asia</span> (21%). In terms of gender parity, which is defined as a share of between 45% and 55% for either sex, gender parity has been achieved in only three regions: <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span>; <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa</span>; and <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia">Central Asia</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>Women researchers remained underrepresented in many countries around the world</strong></p>
            <p>To find the degree of progress in the employment of women in R&D, it is necessary to examine the situation at the individual country level. Figure II displays the proportion of women among the total number of researchers by country for 148 countries with available data for the period 1996–2018. Data show the underrepresentation of women researchers in the vast majority of countries. </p>

            <p>In 129 of 148 countries, women made up less than a half of researchers. In 47 countries, women’s share was less than a third. Nevertheless, significant progress by women researchers was registered in some countries. Women outnumbered men among researchers in the following countries: Argentina, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Myanmar, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, the Philippines, Serbia, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). Gender parity, that is, a share of between 45% and 55% for either sex, has been achieved in only about one in four countries (of the 148 countries with available data).</p>

        <section id="NE8_06">
            <p>To better understand the underlying trends in women’s representation in research, it is useful, inter alia, to look into the career paths of researchers, as well as the sectors of the economy and their fields of research in which they work. Data show that, although there has been an increase in the gender balance <a href=#NE10 class="narrative-ref">among university graduates</a> and a rising level in women’s educational qualifications, female researchers are still underrepresented in countries around the world. </p>

            <p>This has been characterized as a “leaky pipeline” phenomenon, whereby an increase in the number of women graduates does not lead to an increase in the proportion of women researchers.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> Data also show that worldwide, female researchers work chiefly in the academic and government sectors, while male researchers work mainly in the private sector. This is the case even in countries with high shares of women researchers (see the case of the Philippines, described below). Women are underrepresented across all areas of research, including natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical sciences, agricultural sciences, social sciences and humanities, their underrepresentation being most pronounced in the field of engineering and technology.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>

            <h2>Country in focus: the Philippines</h2>
            <p><strong>Women among researchers by sector and field of research</strong></p>
            <p>Even in countries with high shares of women researchers, such as the Philippines, more women work in the academic and government sectors than in the private sector, where men dominate. The proportion of women working in R&D pertaining to the natural sciences and engineering is significantly smaller in comparison to their representation in research in the field of social sciences and humanities (see figure III).</p>
