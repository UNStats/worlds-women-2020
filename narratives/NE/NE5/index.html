            <h2>Backgorund</h2>
            <p>In an increasingly digital world, ICT skills are fundamental, at the individual level, to higher social and economic well-being and, at the national level, to a more dynamic and competitive economy.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> It is widely recognized that a lack of ICT skills act as an impediment to participation in work, school and in society in general — and for women in particular. ICT skills are critical to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, target 4.4, which encourages countries to substantially increase, by 2030, the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p><strong>In the majority of countries worldwide, women lag behind men in all ICT skills</strong></p>
            <p>Data on the gender parity index (GPI)<span class="footnote-index">2</span> in 2018 show that, with few exceptions, women’s ICT skills are considerably behind those of men across all 9 ICT skills in the majority of countries, both developed and developing (see figure I). For each ICT activity, GPI values are smaller than 0.97 in the vast majority of countries, underscoring the fact that overall gender disparities favour men over women. </p>

        <section id="NE5_05">
            <p>Gender disparities against women are moderate for “basic” ICT skills (such as copying and pasting and sending e-mails with attached files) in comparison to those for the more complex “standard” skills (such as downloading and installing software and connecting and installing devices). Gender disparities against women are highest for the “advanced” skill of writing computer programs. It should be noted that gender parity has been achieved in Lithuania and Slovakia, where women’s ICT skills are equal to those of men across the 9 ICT skills. In a handful of countries, including Jamaica, more women than men have ICT skills in both basic and standard ICT categories.</p>

            <p><strong>Women in developing regions are more disadvantaged in basic digital skills</strong></p>
            <p>The lack of data on ICT skills in developing regions limits detailed regional comparisons. Nevertheless, available data (see figure I) suggest that women in developing regions are more disadvantaged than their counterparts in developed regions when it comes to basic digital skills and some of the standard skills. Available data on advanced skills (writing computer programs) provide an unclear picture, as some developing countries that reported lower levels of basic skills also reported higher levels of standard and advanced skills.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NE5_07">
            <p>Research suggests that inequalities in ICT skills at the country level reflect other inequalities, including in education, wealth and gender, and that inequalities in digital skills might lead to increased disparity between developing and developed countries<span class="footnote-index">3</span> and between socioeconomic and sociocultural groups.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> A lack of digital skills is widely understood to be a significant barrier to participation in work and school, in society in general, as well as in home-based activities and in private life.</p>

            <p><strong>Significant gender gaps in advanced ICT skills</strong></p>
            <p>Writing a computer program is the only advanced ICT skill measured in connection with the monitoring of SDG target 4.4. Considerable gender gaps in advanced ICT skills, based on the proportion of women and men who can write a computer program, are noticable in the 70 countries for which data were available for 2019 or the latest available year during the period 2014—2019 (see figure II). </p>

        </section>

        <section id="NE5_09">
            <p>With few exceptions, gender inequalities are primarily against women, and the gender gap is large in several countries in developed regions. For every 100 men who can write a computer program, there are fewer than 33 women with that ability in a number of developed countries, including: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. Only two countries (Brunei Darussalam and Cuba) out of the 70 with available data show gender parity in this advanced ICT skill, and more women than men in Bahrain, Cambodia, Kuwait and Oman can write computer programs.</p>

        </section>


        <section id="NE5_10">
            <p>In the advanced ICT skill of writing computer programs, developed countries are ahead of developing countries by only a small margin. This is party owing to the fact that, in both developing and developed countries, the proportion of the population with skills at the highest level is very low (less than 15%, with few exceptions). This is in contrast to the situation with basic and standard skills, where developed countries have substantial advantage.</p>
