                <li>In 2016, at the global level, maternal conditions were the leading cause of death among young women (aged 15—29); for young men in the same age bracket road injuries were the leading cause of death.</li>

                <li>The leading causes of death among women aged 15-49, both at the global level and in Sub-Saharan Africa, are HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions. Within the same age group, men’s causes of death are globally dominated by road injuries and ischaemic heart disease.</li>

                <li>In 2017, the life-time risk of dying from maternal causes in sub-Saharan Africa was 1 in 37; in Central and Southern Asia it was 1 in 260; and in Latin America and the Caribbean it was 1 in 630.</li>

                <li>In the period 2000—2017, the greatest overall reduction in maternal mortality was achieved in countries in Southern Asia, with a reduction of 59% in the number of deaths (from 384 to 157 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births).</li>

                <li>The risk of maternal death can be reduced through better access to modern methods of contraception, and by ensuring that women have access to high-quality care before, during and after childbirth. There has been significant improvement in reducing maternal mortality worldwide, with increased access to skilled care at delivery, the increase in contraceptive prevalence and the decline in fertility.</li>

                <li>There are marked regional disparities in access to modern contraceptive methods, as well as births attended by skilled personnel, with the lowest access to both being in sub-Saharan Africa, which is also the region with the highest maternal mortality rate.</li>

                <li>Emerging research suggests that Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) pandemic-related worries may influence how women feel about having children. Women may be changing their plans about when and/or how many children to have.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Women’s reproductive years begin at puberty and the onset of <a href=#NH13 class="narrative-ref">menstruation</a> and end with menopause, spanning, on average, ages 15—49. Women’s health status during this period is dominated by issues related to their <a href=#NH14 class="narrative-ref">sexual and reproductive health</a>. During this period, women and men are likely to form families and enter the labour force, and are considered, on average, too young to die. Nevertheless, all types of diseases affect the health of people in this age group.</p>

            <p>As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO):<span class="footnote-index">1</span> (a) maternal conditions (group 1) represent a leading cause of death for women aged 15—49, both at the global level and in developing regions; (b) the risk of death from communicable diseases (also in group 1) is highest among women and men at ages 35—39, when the global death rates from HIV/AIDS peak for both women and men; (c) mortality from non-communicable diseases (group 2) increases with age, and is higher among men; and (d) deaths due to injuries (group 3) are prominent among men aged 15—49, particularly road accidents, as are deaths from suicide and interpersonal violence.</p>

            <h2>Central and Southern Asia are the only regions showing a gender difference in the top leading cause of death among people aged 15-49: self-harm for women and road injury for men</h2>
            <p>In 2016, among women aged 15-49, the leading causes of death at the global level and in Sub-Saharan Africa were HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions. Within the same age group, at the global level men’s causes of death were dominated by road injuries and ischaemic heart disease.</p>
            <p>At the regional level, the top leading causes of death among people aged 15-49 were: self-harm (in Australia and New Zealand, and Northern America and Europe, for both women and men), road <a href=#NH8 class="narrative-ref">injury</a> (in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, for both women and men), and interpersonal violence (in Latin America and the Caribbean, for both women and men). Central and Southern Asia showed a gender difference in the top leading cause of death among people aged 15-49: self-harm for women and road injury for men.</p>

            <h2>Globally, in 2017, an estimated 295,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth</h2>
            <p>Worldwide, maternal conditions were the top cause of death among women aged 20—24 in 2016. The risk of dying from maternal causes is related to the risk of getting pregnant and to the obstetric risk of developing a complication and dying while pregnant, during childbirth or within 42 days postpartum. In resource-poor settings, fertility rates are higher and the risks of dying in labour are greater,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> and thus the risk of dying from maternal causes is greatly amplified. In 2017, the lifetime risk of dying from maternal causes in sub-Saharan Africa was one in 37, in Central and Southern Asia it was one in 260, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it was one in 630 (see figure II).</p>

            <p>Significant progress has been made in in reducing maternal mortality since 2000. During the period 2000—2017, the global maternal mortality rate declined by 38% (from an estimated 342 to 210 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). Over the same period, the greatest overall reduction in the rate was achieved in <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span>, with a reduction of 59% in the number of maternal deaths (from 384 to 157 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). Four other regions roughly halved their maternal mortality rates during this same period: Central Asia (by 52%), Eastern Asia (by 50%), Europe (by 53%) and Northern Africa (by 54%). All four regions, with the exception of Northern Africa, already had relatively low maternal mortality rates in 2000 (less than 100 per 100,000 live births).<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In 2017, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounted for approximately 86% (254,000) of the estimated global maternal deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa alone accounting for roughly two-thirds (196,000) of maternal deaths, while Southern Asia accounted for nearly one-fifth (58,000).<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Despite its high maternal mortality rate in 2017, <span class="label-ref" tag="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> achieved a 40% reduction in maternal mortality in the years since 2000.</p>

            <h2>Wide variations in the maternal mortality ratio and lifetime risk suggest that most maternal deaths are preventable</h2>
            <p>Women die as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these complications develop during pregnancy and most are preventable or treatable. Other complications may exist before pregnancy but worsen during pregnancy, especially if not managed as part of the woman’s health care.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> The major complications, which account for nearly 75% of all maternal deaths, are severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

            <p>In addition to the tragic loss of life, maternal deaths have negative effects on families, including on the physical and mental health of family members. <span class="footnote-index">7</span> <span class="footnote-index">8</span> Studies have shown greatly increased mortality among children whose mothers have died.<span class="footnote-index">9</span> <span class="footnote-index">10</span> <span class="footnote-index">11</span> Other documented effects are of an economic nature, including catastrophic expenditures (for example, health care and funeral expenses), reduced household income and crippling debt;<span class="footnote-index">12</span> <span class="footnote-index">13</span> <span class="footnote-index">14</span> thus, not only are the risks of maternal death elevated by poverty, such deaths may act to reinforce the cycle of poverty in poor communities from one generation to the next.</p>

            <p>Maternal deaths are also influenced by other factors associated with poverty, such as poor nutrition, lack of freedom over <a href=#NH14 class="narrative-ref">reproductive health choices</a> and lack of access to resources. Programmes to address upstream risk factors for maternal death, including by promoting women’s <a href=#NW1 class="narrative-ref">economic empowerment</a> and <a href=#NE21 class="narrative-ref">educational attainment</a>, are also important for the well-being of women and their families.</p>

            <h2>The risk of maternal death can be reduced through better access to modern methods of contraception and by ensuring that women have access to high-quality care before, during and after childbirth</h2>

            <p>Family planning is one of the most important aspects of reproductive health, since the use of modern contraceptive methods allows women to avoid unintended pregnancies. An unintended or unwanted pregnancy may be a pregnancy too early in life, too soon after a previous pregnancy or after a family has been established at a desired size. Like any pregnancy, unwanted pregnancies carry the risk of disability or even death, but they also have added health risks due to the possibility that a woman may choose to have an abortion, and that it might be unsafe. Unlike abortions carried out by skilled personnel in a medically safe environment, unsafe abortions carry a very high risk of complications.</p>

            <p>Between 2010—2014, on average, 56 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year,<span class="footnote-index">15</span> of which around 25 million were unsafe.<span class="footnote-index">16</span> Between 4.7% to 13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion.<span class="footnote-index">17</span> Over half of all estimated unsafe abortions globally were in Asia. In Africa and Latin America, 3 out of 4 abortions were unsafe.<span class="footnote-index">18</span> In almost every case, death and disability could be prevented through sexuality education, use of effective contraception, provision of safe, legal, induced abortion and timely care for complications.<span class="footnote-index">19</span> A study estimated that if all women wanting to avoid pregnancy used a modern contraceptive method, the number of unintended pregnancies would drop by 70% and unsafe abortions by 74%.<span class="footnote-index">20</span></p>

            <p>At the global level, it is estimated that 76.8% of women of reproductive age had their family planning needs met with a modern contraceptive method in 2020 (see figure III). This proportion ranged from 86% in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia to about 52% in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and 56% in sub-Saharan Africa, showing marked inequalities in women’s access to modern contraception across regions. However, it is important to recognize that these figures are an improvement over historic percentages: in sub-Saharan Africa, 13% of women of reproductive age had their family planning needs met with a modern contraceptive method in 1990, and in 2012 that figure was 27%.<span class="footnote-index">21</span> In general, regions with lower levels of <a href=#NP23 class="narrative-ref">fertility</a> have higher proportions of women using contraception.</p>

            <p>Use and access to modern contraceptive methods depend, inter alia, on women’s autonomy. Globally, only around 50% of women can make their <a href=#NH14 class="narrative-ref">own decisions</a> on health care and contraceptive use, and can say no to sexual intercourse.</p>

            <p>The <a href=#NH12 class="narrative-ref">Covid-19</a> pandemic could leave significant numbers of women and couples without access to essential sexual and reproductive health care. The proportion of women of reproductive age (ages 15—49) that have their need for family planning satisfied with <a href=#NP23 class="narrative-ref">modern contraceptive methods</a> could fall from 76.8% to 71%, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. It is estimated that the most impacted regions would be Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa owing to their relatively greater reliance on short-term methods, such as injectables and pills, that require frequent contact with health-care providers.<span class="footnote-index">22</span></p>

            <h2>Globally, during the period 2014—2019, 81% of births took place with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant, up from 64% in the period 2000—2005; however, there are wide disparities across regions</h2>
            <p>Coverage of deliveries by skilled birth attendants ranges from 60% in sub-Saharan Africa to almost universal coverage in Europe and Northern America, Central Asia, Eastern Asia and Western Asia (see figure IV). In sub-Saharan Africa significant gains have been made since the turn of the century, with coverage ranging from 43% in the period 2000—2005 to 51% in the period 2007—2013.

            <h2>Adolescent girls face higher risks of eclampsia, systemic infections and complications during childbirth than adult women</h2>

            <p>In 2018, there were an estimated 12.8 million births among <span class="label-ref" tag="youth">adolescent girls</span> aged 15—19, some 11% of all births worldwide.<span class="footnote-index">23</span> The estimated global adolescent birth rate has declined from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2000 to 41 births per 1,000 in 2020, representing a reduction of 27% in a 20-year span. At the regional level, adolescent birth rates are the lowest in developed regions (12 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in Australia and New Zealand, and 13 in Europe and Northern America) and the highest in sub-Saharan Africa (101 births per 1,000), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (61 births per 1,000). Early childbearing not only has a negative effect on the health of the adolescents and their newborn children, evidence shows that adolescent mothers are at higher risks of eclampsia, systemic infections and complications during childbirth.<span class="footnote-index">24</span> In addition, the stigma and stress adolescents experience may also make them less likely to complete schooling – reducing lifetime opportunities to achieve their full potential and weakening their control over resources and their future lives.<span class="footnote-index">25</span> <span class="footnote-index">26</span> Further insights about trends and levels of <a href=#NP21 class="narrative-ref">adolescent fertility</a> are set out in the section on population and families.</p>
