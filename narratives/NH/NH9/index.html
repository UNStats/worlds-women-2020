                <li>In 2016, non-communicable diseases were the cause of 41 million deaths (21 million among men and 20 million among women), or 71% of global deaths, including 15 million premature deaths (people aged 30—70).</li>
                <li>The risk of dying prematurely from any of the four major non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer; diabetes; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) between ages 30–70 was 21.6% for men and 15% for women. The risk decreased of 5 percentage points for men and of more than 3 percentage points for women, since 2000.The risk of dying prematurely due to non-communicable diseases varies by region, with the highest rate reported in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), where it is as high as 33% among men and 25% among women, and the lowest level of risk in Australia and New Zealand, where it is around 10% for men and 7% for women.</li>
                <li>Gender differences in the risk of premature death due to non-communicable diseases also vary by region, with the largest gender gap in Europe and Northern America, where men are almost twice as likely to die prematurely as women, and the smallest in sub-Saharan Africa, where men and women have equal chances of dying prematurely from non-communicable diseases.</li>

                <li>The Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) pandemic has severely disrupted the delivery of prevention and treatment services for non-communicable diseases in many countries surveyed, notably for: hypertension in 53% of countries; diabetes and diabetes-related complications in 49% of countries; cancer in 42% of countries; and cardiovascular emergencies in 31% of countries.</li>

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>Non-communicable diseases, also known as chronic diseases, which tend to be of long duration, are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> The disease burden from non-communicable diseases among adults, who are in the most economically productive age span, is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing and health transitions.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>
            <p>In developed countries, premature deaths due to non- communicable diseases are frequently associated with occupational risks or individual behaviours, including excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and smoking, which leads to higher rates of death from lung cancer.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="NH9_04">
            <p>The incidence of some non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertensive heart disease, can be prevented or greatly reduced through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, while other conditions, particularly cancers, cannot easily be prevented.</p>
            <p>However, early detection and modern treatment can greatly reduce mortality for many forms of cancer. WHO estimates that about 30% to 50% of cancers can be prevented with lifestyle modifications, such as eliminating tobacco use, being physically active and reducing exposure to carcinogens in the environment.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>
        </section>
        <section id="NH9_05">
            <p>Non-communicable diseases threaten progress towards the achievement of target 3.4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030, as well as towards the overarching Goal of the 2030 Agenda, Goal 1, to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.</p>
            <p>It is predicted that the rapid rise in non-communicable diseases will impede poverty reduction initiatives in developing countries (and even in some developed countries) owing to the associated high health-care costs, loss of employment and reduced income. With household savings drained to pay for often lengthy and expensive medical treatments, millions are forced into poverty annually.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

            <h1>Current situation</h1>
            <p><strong>In 2016, the probability of dying prematurely from any of the four major non-communicable diseases between ages 30–70 was 21.6% for men and 15.0% for women</strong></p>
            <p>In 2016, non-communicable diseases were the cause of 41 million deaths (21 million among men and 20 million among women), or 71% of global deaths,<span class="footnote-index">7</span> including 15 million premature deaths (deaths between ages 30—70). Globally, the probability of dying prematurely from any of the four major non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer; diabetes; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) between ages 30–70 was 21.6% for men and 15% for women. Compared to 2000, those rates represented a significant reduction in the global death rate of 5 percentage points for men and of more than 3 percentage points for women, as well as a marginal decrease in the gender gap of 6.6 percentage points.</p>
            <p>Progress in reducing premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases has slowed since 2010, partly due to a lack of success in addressing a number of <a href=#NH6 class="narrative-ref">risk factors</a>. While tobacco use is steadily declining, obesity is on the rise, and global efforts to decrease alcohol consumption have stagnated and this harmful behaviour is increasing in some regions.<span class="footnote-index">8</span></p>

        <section id="NH9_07">
            <p><strong>The region with highest risk of premature death due to non-communicable diseases, both for women and men, was Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), but the largest gender gap was recorded in Europe and Northern America</strong></p>
            <p>In 2016, the highest risk of premature death from non-communicable diseases was in countries in <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand), where this probability was 33% (one in 3) among men and 25% (one in four) among women. The lowest risk was reported in <span class="label-ref" tag="Australia and New Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</span>, where it was around 10% for men and 7% for women. The gender gap between women and men was least marked in <span class="label-ref" tag="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</span>, where the probability of premature death due was almost the same for both sexes (21% for men and 20% for women). The largest gender gap was in <span class="label-ref" tag="Europe and Northern America">Europe and Northern America</span>, where men were almost twice as likely as women to die between ages 30–70 from non-communicable diseases (20% for men and 11% for women) (see figure).</p>

        <section id="NH9_09">
            <p><strong>Multiple factors influence the risk of mortality from non-communicable diseases</strong></p>
            <p>Biological differences between men and women are contributing factors in variations in the mortality rates related to <a href=#NH11 class="narrative-ref">cancers</a> of the reproductive organs (for example, cervical, breast, prostate and testicular cancers). Death rates may also be influenced by levels of access to diagnosis and treatment: cervical <a href=#NH11 class="narrative-ref">cancer rates</a> are reported at higher rates in low-income countries with poor access to health services.<span class="footnote-index">9</span></p>
            <p>Overall, premature mortality caused by non-communicable diseases continues to be disproportionately concentrated in the most socially disadvantaged countries, with fluctuations in premature mortality rates, in particular among women within and across regions (see figure).<span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>
        </section>
        <section id="NH9_10">
            <p>In many countries, owing to stereotypical ideas about masculinity and other factors, men are less likely to use health services. Women, however, who tend to use health-care services to a greater degree, may exhibit different symptoms for some non-communicable diseases than men and may experience delayed diagnosis and treatment. For example, symptoms for coronary heart disease reported among women, including back pain, nausea or fatigue, may be considered “atypical”, leading to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.<span class="footnote-index">11</span></p>
            <p>For many non-communicable diseases, death rates are driven by exposure to major modifiable <a href=#NH6 class="narrative-ref">risk factors</a>, including: tobacco use; the harmful use of alcohol; unhealthy diet; and physical inactivity, which increases the risk of obesity. All of these risky behaviours vary by sex, with men generally adopting unhealthier lifestyles and taking greater risks than women.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="NH9_11">
            <p>In a health emergency such as the <span class="label-ref" tag="Covid-19"><a href=#NH12 class="narrative-ref">Covid-19</a></span> pandemic, patients with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, have become more vulnerable and at higher risk of dying, not only because they are more susceptible to the virus, but because of the prioritization of medical resources directed towards caring for patients with the disease.</p>
            <p>In a rapid assessment survey of service delivery for non-communicable diseases conducted by WHO, results confirmed that the prevention and treatment services have been severely disrupted by the pandemic.<span class="footnote-index">12</span> More than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment; and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies.<span class="footnote-index">13</span></p>
            <p>Since people with underlying health conditions, in particular the four major non-communicable diseases, are at higher risk of contracting Covid-19, it is critical that efforts to address the burden of these diseases in the global community be reinforced.<span class="footnote-index">14</span></p>
