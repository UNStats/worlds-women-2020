                <li>The survival advantage of females over males results in a higher share of women than men among older persons. Globally, at least 3 out of every 5 persons (62%) aged 80 and over are women and just over a half (54%) of those aged 65 and over are women.</li>

                <li>The share of women among older persons aged 80 and over is the highest in Europe and Northern America (64%) and the lowest in Central and Southern Asia (55%).</li>

                <li>Women over age 65 are generally about twice as likely as older men to live alone in developed countries and three times as likely in developing ones.</li>

                <li>More than 30% of older women (around 18% of men) in Australia and New Zealand and in Europe and Northern America live alone, compared to 13% of older women (4% of men) in Central and Southern Asia and 19% of older women (6% of men) in Northern Africa and Western Asia.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The proportion of women among the total population of older persons gives an indication of the relative mortality rates of women and men until advanced ages. An analysis of the living arrangements of older persons provides information about who they live with, whether alone or with others, and is important as an indication of the level of support that is available to them. In the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, the living arrangements of older people were identified as a topic requiring more attention and research.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p><strong>Women comprise more than a half of the total older population worldwide</strong></p>
            <p>Women comprise more than a half of all older people throughout the world (see figure I). Globally, the share of women among the population aged 65 and older is 54%, and at the regional level, the share ranges from 51% in <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia">Central and Southern Asia</span> to 56% in <span class="label-ref" tag="Europe and Northern America">Europe and Northern America</span>. The proportion of women among older people aged 80 and older is even higher both at the global level (62%), and at the regional level (ranging from 55% in Central and Southern Asia to 64% in Europe and Northern America). This high proportion of women among the older population is due to their survival advantage over men.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

            <p>Increasing life expectancy at older ages has implications for the living arrangements as well as the health and well-being of older people.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In particular, data show that older women are more likely than older men to live alone due to: (a) their higher <a href=#NP3 class="narrative-ref">life expectancy</a>; (b) higher prevalence of widowhood among women; and (c) higher prevalence of remarriage among men after <a href=#NP22 class="narrative-ref">widowhood or divorce</a>.</p>

            <p>As the length of life and thus the proportion of older people in the population increase in many countries, it is important to examine whether this is accompanied by sustained health, decent quality of life and sufficient social and economic resources. Research shows that both the prevalence and severity of disability increase with age. In <span class="label-ref" tag="Australia">Australia</span>, data show that older women are more likely than older men to have a profound or severe <span class="label-ref" tag="disability">disability</span>: 66.4% of women aged 90 years and over, compared with 48.9% of men aged 90 years and over.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> This points to the fact that as more women live to advanced ages, they require greater care and assistance in activities related to daily living, and long-term care always has costs, even when such care is provided by family members on an <a href=#NW25 class="narrative-ref">unpaid basis</a>.</p>

            <p>Since all regions are experiencing growth in the proportion of older people at advanced ages, the need for long-term care will be critical, including in countries where crucial preconditions for care and healthy ageing, such as universal access to water, sanitation and electricity, as well as robust primary health-care systems, are often lacking.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> In addition, as people live longer, and women in particular, they are at higher risk of living in <span class="label-ref" tag="poverty">poverty</span>. For instance, in sub -Saharan Africa, households headed by older women are more likely to be poor than households headed by older men; and in more developed countries, older women in one-person households are more likely than older men to be living in poverty.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

            <h2>National differences in the proportion of women among older people</h2>
            <p>Certain countries have higher shares of women in their population of older people (see figure II). Among the 25 countries with a proportion of women aged 65 years and older that is higher than the global average of 54%, the following have at least 60%: Armenia, Belarus, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Poland, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Ukraine and Viet Nam. In five of those countries(<span class="label-ref" tag="Belarus">Belarus</span>, <span class="label-ref" tag="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</span>, the <span class="label-ref" tag="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</span>, <span class="label-ref" tag="South Africa">South Africa</span> and <span class="label-ref" tag="Ukraine">Ukraine</span>), the share of women among those aged 80 and over is at least 70%, pointing to a much higher female than male survival rate among older people in those countries.</p>

            <h2>Older women are twice as likely as older men to live alone</h2>
            <p>Globally, a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and older live alone (see figure III), in particular women. Worldwide, 24% of women and 12% of men aged 65 and older, and 27% of women and 14% of men aged 80 and over live alone. In addition to the differential in the mortality rate between older women and men, it appears that marital status is a major determinant of the differences in living arrangements between the two groups.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>

            <h2>National differences in the living arrangements of older people</h2>
            <p>There are wide variations in the percentage of people aged 65 and older living alone, even within geographical regions (see figure IV). For example, while 30% of older women and 6% of older men in the Islamic Republic of Iran live alone, in Bangladesh 7% of women and 1% of men in the same age range live by themselves. In Uruguay, 31% of women and 19% of men aged 65 years and over live alone, compared to 6% of older women and 7% of older men in the same age range in Nicaragua. Similarly, the proportion of people aged 80 and older in one-person households in Finland (53% women and 26% men) is significantly higher than in Montenegro (26% women and 12% men).</p>
