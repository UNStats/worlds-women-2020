                <li>The total fertility rate in Finland has declined since 2010, from 1.87 children per woman in 2010 to 1.35 children per woman in 2019, the lowest historically recorded rate.</li>

                <li>A growing proportion of Finnish women and men aged 15—49 live alone without a spouse, and this has contributed significantly to the postponement, or prevention, of childbearing: the proportion of women aged 28—32 living without a spouse was 20% in 2019, compared to 14% in 1999. The corresponding proportion of men aged 30—34 was 28% in 2019 compared to 20% in 1999.</li>

                <li>In 2019, first-time mothers in Finland were 2 years older, on average, than first-time mothers in 2000; first-time fathers were also older than the average age 20 years ago: the age difference between parents has remained at around 2 years over the last decades.</li>

                <li>A married couple with children is the most common family model in Finland, representing 57% of all families in 2019. Nevertheless, the number and proportion of one-parent families is on the rise. Lone-mother families represented 17% of families with children in 2000 and 20% in 2019; lone-father families represented 2% of families with children in 2000 and 3% in 2019.</li>
                <li>The average age of mothers at the birth of their first child has increased.</li>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>Over the course of the last few decades, women’s average age at the beginning of childbearing has increased. In 2019, first-time mothers in Finland were older than had previously been the case: the average age of first-time mothers in 2019 was 29.6 years, compared to 27.6 in 2000 (see figure I). This is connected to decreasing female fertility rates for the birth of the first child among women under age 30, coupled with increasing rates of fertility in older age groups.</p>

            <p>On average, men are two years older than women when they become parents for the first time. In 2019, men became fathers for the first time at age of 31.6. Like mothers, first-time fathers were older than in previous decades: the difference in the ages of first-time mothers and first-time fathers has remained at around two years over the last decades.</p>

            <h2>Total fertility rate has been declining since around 2010</h2>
            <p>In Finland, the total fertility rate has declined remarkably since 2010, when it was 1.87 children per woman — by 2019 the fertility rate was at an all-time low, at 1.35 children per woman. Compared to the rate in 2000, the birth rate fell in the first two decades of the twenty-first century (see figure II). The decline has been connected to the postponement of childbearing to older ages. As reported above, in 2019 the mean age of women giving birth for the first time was 29.6 years, and for first-time fathers the mean age was 31.6 years.</p>

        <section id="NP26_05">
            <h2>The mean age at first birth is increasing - why?</h2>
            <p>Since the 1970s, on average, women have been giving birth to their first child at later ages than previously recorded — this during a period of time when women’s participation in education and the labour force has continued to grow exponentially. In the Family Barometer 2017,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> women, unlike men, expressed concern over career breaks caused by combining childbearing and employment, possibly because having children was considered either undesirable or inappropriate in the work environment, in particular for women in fixed-term employment.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> To address this situation, women have adopted different ways of working, including part-time work, in order to schedule family leave: the demands of fixed-term employment on women have been a contributing factor in the decision to postpone childbearing.<span class="footnote-index">3</span></p>

            <p>Traditional obligations for women, such as childcare and other family responsibilities, on the one hand and the demands of working life and career on the other have been perceived as contradictory and difficult to coordinate. In general, employers have not been expected to anticipate the situation of women of reproductive age, and jobs that were family-friendly were rare and sought after. For men, having children has not been seen as a reason for absence from work nor for adding childcare to their responsibilities in the home.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>

            <p>It has also been suggested that the upswing in the number of small families and delayed childbearing are evidence of new kinds of problems and challenges, including difficulties in conceiving children and unwanted childlessness.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> In addition, a growing proportion of Finnish women of childbearing age live alone, without a spouse, as do a growing number of men in the same age bracket, and this has contributed significantly to the trend towards postponing, or preventing, childbearing. For example, in 2019, 20% of women aged 28—32 and 28% of men aged 30—34 lived alone without a spouse, compared to 14% of women and 20% of men in 1999.</p>

            <h2>Living arrangements for children aged 18 and below</h2>
            <p>Married couples with children are the most common family model in Finland, representing 57% of all families with children in 2019. Although there has been a steady decline over the years in this type of family, both in absolute and relative terms, other types of families with children are still far less prevalent.</p>

            <p>In 2019, <a href=#NP18 class="narrative-ref">one-parent families</a> represented almost one-fourth (23%) of all families with children. Families of mothers and children represented about 20% of all families with children. Even though the number of families with a single father and children has grown, the number is still very low, and such families make up only 3% of all families with children. Nevertheless, the overall number and the share of one-parent families is on the rise. In 2000, 17% of families with children were composed of mothers and children and 2% were composed of fathers with children.
