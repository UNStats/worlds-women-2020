            <h2>Gender segregation persists in various occupations</h2>
            <p>Globally in 2020, women and men were largely employed in different occupations (horizontal segregation) and in different positions within the same occupation or occupational group (vertical segregation). Relative to their share in overall employment (39%), women had a higher representation among clerical support workers (57%), service and sales workers (50%), professionals (49%) and technicians and associate professionals (45%). Men were more commonly employed as plant and machine operators and assemblers (80%), craft and related trades workers (76 %) and managers (72%). In the last category, women constituted only 28% of the total number of <a href=#ND1 class="narrative-ref">managerial personnel</a>.</p>
            <p>Over the past 25 years, while their share in total employment has remained constant, the proportion of women employed as clerical support workers, the most common occupation for women in 1995, has fallen by 3 percentage points while the proportion of women employed as managers has risen by the same percentage point level (see figure I), revealing a minor but important increase in women’s representation in managerial positions.

            <h2>Transition to high-skilled jobs has taken place at a higher rate among women than men in most regions</h2>
            <p>The nine major occupational groups classified by ISCO-08 are also associated with three broad skill levels: level 1 (low); level 2 (middle); and levels 3 and 4 (high). While occupations at skill level 1 include simple and routine physical or manual assignments, occupations at skill levels 3 and 4 typically require problem-solving, decision-making and creativity, including complex technical and practical assignments in a specialized field. As employment has transitioned over the past 25 years between <a href=#NW2 class="narrative-ref">economic sectors</a>, mostly from the agriculture to the services sector, certain lower-skilled jobs have been replaced with high-skilled ones calling for the skills of managers, professionals and technicians.</p>
            <p>In all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), the proportion of high-skilled women workers has increased at a higher rate since 2000, surpassing, in 2019, the proportion of high-skilled men workers (see figure II); in Europe and Northern America, 48% of women work in high-skilled jobs (in contrast to 41% for men); as well as 50% of women in Australia and New Zealand (as opposed to 43% for men).</p>

            <h2>Gender segregation in occupations is closely linked to stereotypical gender roles</h2>
            <p>The segregation of women and men in different occupations is also associated with stereotypes about women, for example that they are more caring or more focused on activities based in the home. Across the 121 countries examined by ILO as of 2019 using the latest available data, the occupations most commonly held by women comprised personal care workers,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> who were 88% women compared to 12% men, and health professionals,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> including general medical doctors and nurses, a broad category, within which women represented 69% of the total workers. In certain areas, gender-based occupational segregation reflects the difference between women and men in terms of their paths in education and vocational training, <a href=#NE15 class="narrative-ref">including in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)</a>. High-skilled occupations in ICT, science and engineering were mostly occupied by men and the women’s representation remained minimal. As of 2019, only one in five ICT professionals were women and they represented only 28% of science and engineering professionals (see figure III).</p>
            <p>Analysis of the data at detailed levels for different occupations reveals that there is vertical segregation, with women more concentrated in certain subcategories within the various occupations. Furthermore, in 2020, while women’s representation in managerial positions only reached 28% globally, their level of access to higher decision-making positions in management remained at an even lower level. In 50 out of 78 countries with available data for the years from 2015 to 2019, the proportion of women holding senior and middle management positions, including as chief executive officers, senior officials and legislators, was lower than their overall share among managers.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> The highest representation by women in managerial positions was reported in the <span class="label-ref" tag="Seychelles">Seychelles</span> in 2015, a time when women made up nearly half of all senior and middle managers (49%) while also holding almost half of overall managerial positions (48%).</p>
            <p>Differences in the average earnings of women and men are partially the result of explained factors that combine gender inequalities in many areas, including across and within occupational groups. Gender segregation in occupations contributes to the <a href=#NW21 class="narrative-ref">gender pay gap</a>, especially when there is a difference in the employment of women and men between low- and high-paying occupations.

            <h2>Covid-19</h2>
            <p>Women have been more negatively affected than men during the recession brought about by Covid-19 since many women work in economic sectors and occupations that have suffered severely from the pandemic. Specifically, the <a href=#NW26 class="narrative-ref">unemployment rate</a> has been higher in occupations that could not be carried out remotely, through teleworking, and in the case of “social jobs” requiring human interaction, which have been rendered less secure because of pandemic-related restrictions.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>
            <p>Most notably, women are on the front lines in the battle against the pandemic as they make up over 70% of workers in the health sector,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> who face higher infection risks than men in the workplace.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
