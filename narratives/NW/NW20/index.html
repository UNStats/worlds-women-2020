                <li>In Brazil, 23% of young people (30% of young women and 19% of young men) were not in employment, education or training (NEET) in 2018.</li>

                <li>Since 2012, there has been a 15% growth in the proportion of youth classified as NEET, with a much larger increase among young men (25%) than young women (8%), mainly due to an overall increase in unemployment during the same period.</li>

                <li>NEET rates varied across regions within the country, and are lower in more developed regions, including differences by colour/race. Black or brown women had a higher NEET rate (32%) than white women (24%), and double the rate recorded among white men (16%).</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The proportion of young people who are not in employment, education or training (the “NEET rate”) is an important indicator for addressing a broad set of vulnerabilities among youth, such as unemployment, early school leaving and a widespread sense of discouragement about finding paid work (so-called labour market discouragement).<span class="footnote-index">1</span> From a gender perspective, this indicator is crucial for monitoring how upcoming generations of young women are being affected by the traditional challenges faced by women, namely the balance between paid work and unpaid domestic and care work at home, including, for this specific cohort, the impact of the NEET rate on their opportunities to attain higher educational and professional qualifications.</p>

            <h2>Almost one in four young people in Brazil were in the NEET group, with higher rates recorded for young women than young men</h2>
            <p>In 2018, there were around 32.4 million people in the youth population (aged 15—24) in Brazil; of that total, 7.3 million people (23%) were included in the NEET group. Young women comprised 49% of the youth population, but 59% of the NEET group. In addition, considering the NEET rate by sex, almost 30% of <span class="label-ref" tag="youth">young women</span> were not employed, engaged in education or training compared to 19% of young men. Estimates provided by the International Labour Organization (ILO) reveal that the Brazilian rate is similar to rates observed for young women <a href=#NW18 class="narrative-ref">globally</a> , but that the rate in Brazil is higher than that in other countries in the same region, such as Argentina (23%) and Chile (19%) (see figure I).</p>

            <h2>NEET rates varied across regions and/or by colour/race</h2>
            <p>Because Brazil covers a huge territory, which is highly heterogeneous and socially unequal, further data disaggregation and analysis are crucial for gaining a better understanding of the NEET rate in the country. The difference in NEET rates among regions reaches up to 12 percentage points. In 2018, the proportion of NEET was 29% in the northeast (the least developed region of the country) and 17% in the southeast (a more developed region). In addition to regional differences, <span class="label-ref" tag="ethnicity">black or brown women</span> had a higher NEET rate (32%) than white women (24%), and double that of white men (16%).</p>

            <p>There has been a 15% growth in the proportion of the NEET population since 2012,<span class="footnote-index">2</span> with a higher rate of increase among young men (25%) than young women (8%), mainly due to an overall increase in unemployment during the same time period (unemployed individuals are considered to be part of the NEET group). The gender difference in NEET rates, which was 12 percentage points in 2012, had decreased to 9 percentage points in 2018, although it remained significantly higher for women (see figure II).</p>

        <section id="NW20_07">
            <p>It is important to highlight that carrying out <a href=#NW25 class="narrative-ref">domestic chores and caring for family</a> members is historically affected by traditional gender roles, which affect the entry and retainment of women in the labour market. In Brazil, 93% of women and 80% of men over age 14 reported doing some unpaid domestic chores and unapid care work activities in 2018. Moreover, the amount of this unpaid work done by women and men was also markedly different: on average, 21 hours a week for women and 11 hours for men. Among <span class="label-ref" tag="youth">youth</span>, the inequality in the distribution of this undervalued and unpaid work was even more unfavorable to women: 88% of young women reported carrying out such work versus 67% of young men.</p>
