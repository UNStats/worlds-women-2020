                <li>In 2020, employment in the agriculture sector continued to decline for both women and men, while their employment in the services sector kept on growing, engaging 59% of employed women and 45% of employed men, and resulting in a gender gap of 14 percentage points, a significant increase since 1995.</li>

                <li>During the period 1995–2020, women’s employment in the industry sector has decreased slightly, to 16%, and increased to 28% for men, widening the gender gap in this sector to 12 percentage points.</li>

                <li>In 2019, the majority of women and men worked in the services sector. In four regions, Northern America, Australia and New Zealand, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean, more than 80% of employed women worked in the services sector in 2019.</li>

                <li>In three regions, agriculture remained the largest sector for women’s employment (over 50%) in 2019: Southern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand).</li>

                <li>With the movement of more women into jobs in the services sector, their share in that sector (45%) has surpassed their share in total employment (39%). Women’s employment is concentrated in four services subsectors: human health and social work; education; private households<span class="footnote-index">1</span> (usually referred to as paid domestic workers); and accommodation and food service activities.</li>

                <li>Globally in 2019, 79% of paid domestic workers were women, a slight reduction from 83% in 2015.</li>

                <li>Even before the onset of the Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, women made up over 70% of workers in the health sector and are now on the front lines in the battle against the pandemic, facing a higher risk of infection than men in the workplace.</li>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>In 2020, worldwide, while the distribution of women and men employed across the three sectors of economic activity, agriculture, industry, and services, was not equal, the services sector was the largest source of employment for both, particularly for women: 59% of women and 45% of men were employed in the services sector, resulting in a gender gap of 14 percentage points, a significant increase since 1995.</p>
            <p>Over the past 25 years, the agriculture sector has declined in prominence as source of employment. In 1995, 40% of women and 42% of men worked in the sector; by 2020, it employed only 25% of women and 27% of men. Despite the decline in terms of overall employment, the gender gap in the agriculture sector has remained unchanged at around two percentage points over the past 25 years. In the industry sector, in contrast, over the period 1995–2020, women’s employment has slightly decreased to 16% and men’s employment has increased to 28%, resulting in a widened gender gap of 12 percentage points (see figure I).
            </p>
            <p><strong>For both women and men, employment in agriculture continues to decline while employment in the services sector keeps growing</strong></p>

            <h2>As of 2019, women worked predominantly in the services sector, while increasingly men were employed in the industry sector</h2>
            <p>In four regions, <span class="label-ref" tag="Europe and Northern America">Northern America</span>, <span class="label-ref" tag="Australia and New Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</span>, <span class="label-ref" tag="Europe and Northern America">Europe</span> and <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span>, more than 80% of women were employed in the services sector in 2019. In those regions, the proportion of men employed in the services sector, while relatively high compared to the proportion of men working in agriculture and industry, was at least 20 percentage points lower than that of women (see figure II).</p>
            <p>In 2019, agriculture remained the largest sector for women’s employment (over 50%) in three regions, <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span>, <span class="label-ref" tag="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> and <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand). In the following two regions, women were also more likely than men to be working in agriculture: there was a gender gap of 15 percentage points in Northern Africa and 8 percentage points in Western Asia.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
            <p>In 2019, in all regions, men were more likely to work in the industry sector than women, with a gender difference ranging from six percentage points in sub-Saharan Africa to 22 percentage points in Australia and New Zealand and Europe. The industry sector absorbed between 25% and 35% of men’s employment in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa (14%) and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (13%). The proportion of women employed in the industry sector was below 20% in all regions except Eastern Asia (24%).

            <h2>Women’s work was concentrated in four services subsectors: human health and social work; education; private households; and accommodation and food service activities</h2>
            <p>Over the past 25 years, more women have moved into jobs in the services sector, and by 2020 the proportion of women in that sector had surpassed their proportion in total employment. In 2020, the proportion of women among the total of people employed was 39% globally and 45% among those employed in the services sector, a minor increase from 42% in 1995.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> Within the sector, women’s work was concentrated in specific subcategories. Globally, women represented more than 50% of the work force in the following four services subsectors in 2020, in order of importance: human health and social work (70%), education (62%), private households<span class="footnote-index">4</span> (57%) and accommodation and food service activities (54%).</p>
            <p>In all countries, men tended to dominate work in other services subsectors, including: (a) 86% in transport, storage and communications; (b) 69% in public administration and defence; compulsory social security; and (c) 62% in real estate; and business and administrative activities.</p>
            <p>Women were more likely than men to work in the most vulnerable jobs, with low pay, long hours and no social protections.<span class="footnote-index">5</span> These unfavourable employment conditions are particularly prevalent for the women working in the private households subsector, who are most often paid domestic workers in <a href=#NW5 class="narrative-ref">informal employment</a>. In 2019, worldwide, 4% of women and 1% of men were employed in this subsector, with the highest proportion of women reported at 18% in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand). Globally, 79% of employed persons in this subsector in 2019 were women,<span class="footnote-index">6</span> slightly down from 83% in 2015.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
            <p><a href=#NW11 class="narrative-ref">Discrimination</a>, namely through legal frameworks, social norms and/or institutional structures, can restrict women’s access to paid work in specific sectors, leading to gender segregation in employment. As of 2020, in 74 countries and territories with available data, aside from limitations imposed on pregnant, nursing and postpartum women, women were also broadly restricted from working in industry subsectors such as mining and quarrying; manufacturing; and construction.<span class="footnote-index">8</span>

            <p>Moreover, women aged 15 years and above accounted for more than their overall share in employment in two out of the four subsectors hardest hit by the pandemic: wholesale and retail trade (44%); and accommodation and food service activities (54%).<span class="footnote-index">9</span></p>
