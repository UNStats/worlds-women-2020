            <ul class="key-points">
                <li>Labour force participation rates in Japan have increased since 2001, particularly among women aged 15—64 (70%) and 25—44 years (76%) as of 2018.</li>

                <li>During the period 1980—2018, the share of dual-income households doubled, while the share households with working men and economically inactive women declined by almost half.</li>

                <li>55.3% of women in dual-income households work as non-regular employees; they constitute 68.1% of total non-regular employees as of 2019.</li>

                <li>Large gender gaps are observed in the responses of women and men aged 34—54 among their reasons for choosing non-regular work, including “working at a convenient time”, “supplementing family income” and “handling housework, childcare and nursing care work.”</li>

                <li>Although non-regular employment facilitates flexible working arrangements, it is one of the main factors contributing to the gender pay gap in Japan.</li>

        <section id="NW27_03">
            <p>In 2015, the Government of Japan passed the “Act on the Promotion of Female Participation and Career Advancement in the Workplace”<span class="footnote-index">1</span> to promote women’s participation in the labour force. Data for 2018 show a significant increase in the female <a href=#NW1 class="narrative-ref">labour force participation rate</a> since 2001, which reached almost 70% among all working-age women (ages 15—64) and 76% among prime-age working women (25—44) and resulted in a gender gap in participation of 14 and 8 percentage points, respectively. These data represent an improvement from 2001, when the gender gap for the two age groups was 23 and 18 percentage points, respectively (see figure I).</p>

        <section id="NW27_04">
            <p>The growth in the number of dual-income households since 1980 is evidence of progress in increasing women’s participation in the labour force. Over this time period, the number of dual-income households doubled in size while the number of households with working men and economically inactive women fell at the same ratio (see figure II).</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW27_05">
            <p>Statistics also indicate, however, that 55.3% of women in dual-income households work as non-regular employees.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> As of 2019, 68.1% of the total number of non-regular employees were women.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> While the proportion of female regular employees is increasing, it remains at around 44%. In addition, the non-regular employment rate demonstrates opposing trends by sex and age. While the proportion of male non-regular employees reaches the highest point among ages <span class="label-ref" tag="older persons">ages 65 and older</span> (30%), female non-regular employees are generally younger, with the peak observed among those aged 45—54 (25%). Gender gaps are also recorded under “reasons for taking a non-regular employment" (see figure III). The majority of female employees aged 35—54 gave reasons including: “for working at a convenient time”, “to supplement family income” and “to handle housework, childcare and nursing care work”, with significant gender gaps among the reasons given by women and men in the same age group (see figure III).</p>

        <section id="NW27_06">
            <p>While non-regular employment allows women to adopt a flexible working style, it is also one of the main factors contributing to the <a href=#NW21 class="narrative-ref">gender pay gap</a> (see figure IV). Policies are being implemented to achieve gender equality in the workplace, including the adoption of a plan to promote the transition of working from non-regular to regular employment, the facilitation of <a href=#NW24 class="narrative-ref">maternity and care leave</a> and the prevention of sexual harassment in the work place.</p>
