            <p>Part-time work may offer an effective way to balance time spent on paid work, household responsibilities and childrearing, and being able to work for fewer hours is also seen as a means to increase employment levels, particularly among women.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> In addition, part-time work facilitates the gradual entry into, participation in and exit from the labor market.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

            <p>Part-time work comes at a cost for workers, however, as they oftentimes face difficult working conditions, including lower hourly wages and little job security, and receive less training and promotion opportunities than their full-time counterparts. They are also at a higher risk of falling into poverty and are less likely to have access to social protections, including <a href=#NW26 class="narrative-ref">unemployment benefits</a>.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In developed countries, some forms of part-time work in are defined as non-standard work, with employment conditions similar to those described under <a href=#NW26 class="narrative-ref">informal employment</a>.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> The proportion of part-time employment in informal wage employment was almost twice as high among women than among men, resulting in their greater exposure to the compounded vulnerabilities of part-time and informal employment.</p>

            <p>Among the 20 countries with available data since 1995, all of which are located in developed regions, trends for part-time employment have been mixed both for employed women and men. In the majority of those countries, there has been an increase in the proportion of part-time employment in women’s and men’s total employment, notably by 30 percentage points for women in <span class="label-ref" tag="Austria">Austria</span> and by 18 percentage points for men in <span class="label-ref" tag="Germany">Germany</span> (see figure III). In general, the incidence of part-time work among employed women has decreased in Northern Europe, the <span class="label-ref" tag="Netherlands">Netherlands</span> and the United States of America. As a point of reference, the proportion of part-time employment in women’s total employment was 82% in the Netherlands in 1995.</p>

            <h2>Time-related underemployment is higher among young women and men</h2>
            <p>Part-time employment is not necessarily a choice, and a significant number of people in part-time employment would prefer to work full-time. This is measured by the time-related underemployment rate, which in 2019 was slightly higher at the global level among women (11%) than among men (10%). Young women and men aged 15–24 were twice as likely to want to work more hours (20%). In <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa</span>, where women’s unemployment rate was the highest among all regions, women’s time-related underemployment rate stood at 26%, compared with 14% for men.</p>
