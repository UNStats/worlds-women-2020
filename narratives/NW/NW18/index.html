            <ul class="key-points">
                <li>In 2019, among youth aged 15–24 worldwide, 31.1% of young women and 13.9% of young men were not in education, employment or training. The gender gap in youth NEET rates has remained constant, at around 17%, since 2005.</li>

                <li>Across regions in 2019, while NEET rates among young men remained relatively constant, among young women the rates varied greatly, reaching above 40% in countries in Western Asia and Southern Asia, more than three times the rate among young men. The gender gap in the NEET rate was relatively small in developed regions.</li>

                <li>The higher prevalence in the proportion of young women in countries in Southern Asia who are not in education, employment or training accompanied with a relatively low youth unemployment may indicate a level of discouragement about entering into and participating in the labour market.</li>

                <li>Higher NEET rates among young women may prevent them from increasing their chances of future employability by gaining experience through employment or honing their skills through education or training.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The <span class="label-ref" tag="youth">youth</span> NEET rate is a useful complement to the youth <a href=#NW26 class="narrative-ref">unemployment rate</a> in gaining a better understanding of the labour market dynamics affecting young women and men, including their potential contribution to sustainable development through work. The NEET rate includes young persons who are outside the labour force and not engaged in education or training. For example, a low youth unemployment rate and a high proportion of NEET may indicate that young people are discouraged about entering the labour market. In the case of young women, a high relative NEET rate may also be linked to their disproportionate engagement in <a href=#NW25 class="narrative-ref">unpaid domestic and care work</a><span class="footnote-index">1</span> and a lack of available social services to balance family life and other activities.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>In 2019, the proportion of youth aged 15–24 not in education, employment or training constituted 31.1% of the young female and 13.9% of the young male population, resulting in a gender gap of 17.2%. Since 2005, the NEET rate among young women has slightly decreased in all regions, with the exception of Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), while it has remained relatively stable among young men. Over the same period, the gender gap in the youth NEET rate has narrowed only slightly, by 3 percentage points (see figure I).</p>

        <section id="NW18_05">
            <p>Among 111 countries and territories with latest available data between 2015 and 2019, the proportion of young women not in education, employment or training was the highest in Afghanistan (65.9%), Pakistan (54.9%) and Zambia (49.5%) and the lowest in Japan (3.5%), the Netherlands (4.2%) and Norway (4.6%). The proportion of young men not in education, employment or training was the highest in Kiribati (46.2%), Zambia (36.4%) and Armenia (35.7%) and the lowest in Japan (2.2%), Singapore (3.1%) and Czechia (3.6%). The gender gap in the youth NEET rate was the highest in Afghanistan (47.6 percentage points), Bangladesh (34.8 percentage points) and Guatemala (39.6 percentage points).</p>

            <p><strong>The gender gap in the proportion of youth not in education, employment or training is significant in developing regions</strong></p>
            <p>Across regions, while NEET rates remained relatively constant among young men, ranging between 9% and 18%, except in Oceania (excluding Australia in New Zealand), those rates among young women varied greatly, reaching above 45% in Southern Asia (more than three times the rate among young men) and above 40% in Western Asia in 2019.</p>
            <p>Overall, the proportion was higher among young women than among young men in all regions except Australia and New Zealand (no gender difference) (see figure II). NEET rates among young women were at least 10 percentage points higher than those among young men in South-Eastern Asia (10.5 percentage points), Latin America and the Caribbean (14.6 percentage points) and Northern Africa (18 percentage points), and the NEET gender gap reached 35% in Southern Asia and 26% in Western Asia. The gender gap was relatively small in Northern America (0.7 percentage points) and Europe (1.7 percentage points).</p>

            <p>In 2019, the highest proportion of young women not in education, employment or training was in countries in <span class="label-ref" tag="Southern Asia">Southern Asia</span> (48.7%), where the unemployment rate for women aged 15–24 stood at 18.4%, similar to the overall youth unemployment rate of 18.8%. The relatively much higher prevalence of NEET than unemployment among young women in Southern Asia may indicate a level of discouragement about entering into and participating in the labour market.</p>

            <p>Discriminatory <a href=#NW8 class="narrative-ref">social norms</a> and <a href=#NW11 class="narrative-ref">legal barriers</a> are likely to contribute to the youth NEET rate, preventing young women, in particular, from increasing their future employability by gaining experience through employment or honing their skills through education or training.</p>

            <p>In <span class="label-ref" tag="Armenia">Armenia</span> in 2017, while 3% of young women aged 17 were married, the share was 28% among young women not in education, employment or training of the same age. Among men, however, the starting age for family formation did not seem to vary by NEET status: overall marriage rates among young men, whether in NEET status or not, were similar across the 15–24 age category.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>
