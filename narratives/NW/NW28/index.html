            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Globally, digital technologies are transforming ways of living in an unprecedented fashion. Today, the Internet, the most prominent of these digital technologies, is one of the most important tools, if not the most important, in the world. The use of the Internet has a major impact on the economy, helping to raise productivity, enable trade and e-commerce and enhance research and innovation through a more efficient and effective diffusion of ideas. The social impact of Internet use is equally significant, providing access to a wealth of information, including through social media platforms, and facilitating global communication. The outbreak of the Coronavirus-19 (<span class="label-ref" tag="Covid-19">Covid-19</span>) pandemic has made connectivity even more important, with the shifting of work, education, communication and leisure to online forums for those fortunate enough to have access to the Internet.</p>

        <section id="NW28_04">
            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p>Use of these technologies is uneven: in 2019, 3.6 billion people, almost half of the world population, did not have access to the Internet.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> There is a clear digital divide between developed regions, where 86.6% of the population is using the Internet, and developing regions, which have an overall share of 47% in Internet usage. In the least developed countries, only 19.1% of the population is using the Internet.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_05">
            <h2>The most visible digital divide is the one between women and men</h2>
            <p>Beyond development status, there are additional digital divides, such as by level of education, skills and geographical location (including urban versus rural), but the most visible is the digital divide by sex. In many places, women have less access to technology and hence use it less than men.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_06">
            <p>In 2019, 58.3% of men were using the Internet, against only 48.4% of women (see figure I), resulting in a difference of 10 percentage points. In developed countries, there was a small gender gap, with 87.6% of men and 85.6% of women were using the Internet. In developing countries, there was a significant difference between men using the Internet (52.8%) and women (40.7%). Furthermore, the difference in levels of access to the Internet between men (24.4%) and women (13.9%) in the least developed countries was significant.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_07">
            <p>A similar picture emerges from a regional perspective. In regions with a high Internet use penetration, including Australia and New Zealand, Northern America and Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean, there were only small differences in usage between men and women. In other regions, however, the gaps were substantial, with the exception of Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) where Internet use was low overall.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_08">
            <h2>The gender gap among Internet users has grown wider in developing regions</h2>
            <p>A better way to explore the digital gender divide is to look at the gender gap in relative terms, by dividing the difference in men’s and women’s Internet use by men’s Internet use and multiplying by 100 (see figure II).</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_09">
            <p>The global gender gap among Internet users stood at 17% in 2019, which represented an increase of six percentage points compared with the gap in 2013. The main reason for this increase is a large uptake in use of the Internet by men in developing regions, not matched by an equally large uptake in use by women. In developed regions, the gender gap is disappearing, dropping from 5.8% in 2013 to 2.3% in 2019. In developing regions, on the other hand, the gender gap was estimated to have increased from 15.8% to 22.8%, and in least developed countries from 29.9% to 42.8%.</p>
            <p>Data disaggregated at the regional level, available only for 2019, shows that the digital gender gap was markedly high in <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia">Central and Southern Asia</span> (51.3%), and substantial in sub-Saharan Africa (33.2%) and Western Asia and Northern Africa (21.2%). As noted above, the gender gap was small in Australia and New Zealand (0.7%), Northern America and Europe (2%) and <span class="label-ref" tag="Latin America and the Caribbean">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> (2.1%).</p>

            <h2>Globally, women are less likely than men to own a mobile phone</h2>
            <p>Ownership of mobile phones is an important tool for reducing gender inequality, and the effect of mobile phone access for women has been shown to accelerate economic and social development. However, globally a gender gap for this indicator is evident.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="NW28_11">
            <p>Among 84 United Nations Member States and territories with latest available sex-disaggregated data for the period 2016—2018, mobile phone ownership among men, on average, was 6.8 percentage points higher than for women (see figure III). In 24 of those countries, more women than men owned a mobile phone, but the gender gap was small; in <span class="label-ref" tag="Chile">Chile</span>, however, women’s mobile phone ownership was substantially higher than that of men. In 23 of the 84 countries countries with latest available sex-disaggregated data, men’s ownership was more than 10 percentage points higher than women’s ownership, reaching as high as 53 percentage points in the Niger and 42 percentage points in Côte d'Ivoire. In most of the countries that had a large gender gap in mobile phone ownership, there was also a large gender gap in Internet usage.</p>
