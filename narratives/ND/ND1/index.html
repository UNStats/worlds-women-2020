              Although higher proportions of women in decision-making roles in
              the private sector has a positive correlation to superior
              corporate profitability, the proportion of women in managerial
              positions remains low in both the public and private sectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Globally, women held only 28% of managerial positions in 2019,
              with some regional variations, and in countries in Northern Africa
              and Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia the proportion
              barely reached 13%, a statistic that has not changed significantly
              over the past 20 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since 2000, while the proportion of women in managerial positions
              has increased in most regions, the rate of improvement is slight.
            </li>
            <li>
              The underrepresentation of women in management positions is even
              more visible at the higher levels of decision-making: 48% of
              companies surveyed by the International Labour Organization (ILO)
              in 2018<span class="footnote-index">1</span> had at least one
              woman in senior management, but only 31% had women in top
              executive positions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Women CEOs or top managers are even more scarce: only 18% of
              enterprises surveyed by the World Bank had a woman CEO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Among Fortune 500 corporations, women accounted for only 7.4%, or
              37 out of 500 CEOs. Despite the minor improvement from 1998, when
              only 1 out of the top 500 corporations had a female CEO, the
              gender gap at the level of top corporate decision makers remains
              significant.
            </li>
            <li>
              The bigger the enterprise, the lower the chances of it having a
              woman CEO: over 26% of small enterprises surveyed by ILO in 2018
              (employing 2 to 100 workers) had female CEOs, compared with 16% of
              large enterprises (employing more than 250 workers).
            </li>
            <li>
              Enterprises with more women in their workforce are more likely to
              have a female CEO. Of the enterprises surveyed by ILO in 2018,
              enterprises with a gender balanced workforce were 15% more likely
              to have a female CEO; and enterprises with a predominantly female
              workforce (between 61% and 100%) were 22% more likely to have a
              female CEO.

          Gender diversity in managerial positions, as evidenced by greater
          representation of women in senior roles, as CEOs and senior-level

          of studies have shown that a higher proportion of women in

          <strong>
            Women are less likely than men to be employed and if employed are
            less likely to hold managerial positions.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, on average, women comprised 39% of the
          <a href="#NW1" class="narrative-ref">workforce worldwide</a>, but held
          only 28% of managerial positions.<span class="footnote-index">4</span>

            >Europe and Northern America</span

            >Northern Africa and Western Asia</span

          <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia"
            >Central and Southern Asia</span
          >, women barely reached 13% of such positions – less than half the

        <p>
          Since 2000, the proportion of women in managerial positions has
          increased in all regions, although their numbers remain
          disproportionately low and overall there has only been a slight
          improvement. In particular, female managers in countries in
          <span class="label-ref" tag="Central and Southern Asia"
            >Central and Southern Asia</span

          have remained in the minority over the last 20 years, with the share

            More women are employed in junior management than in senior and
            middle management positions, and the glass ceiling is more difficult
            to break through at the top echelons of management
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the majority of countries in the world, more women work in junior
          managerial positions than at the level of senior and middle
          management. In countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, however,
          where the proportion of women managers tends to be the highest, there
          are some country variations in the proportion of women in top
          management positions, relative to their overall share in management
          (see figure III).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="ND1_08">
        <p>
          The finding that fewer women than men are represented at the higher
          levels of management is also supported by an ILO survey conducted in
          2018,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> which collected a sample of
          almost 13,000 companies in 70 countries across five regions:
          sub-Saharan Africa; Asia and the Pacific; Europe and Central Asia;
          Latin America and the Caribbean; and the Middle East and Northern
          Africa.<span class="footnote-index">6</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey showed that more than 60% of companies had at least one
          woman in supervisory, junior or administrative management and middle
          management. However, at the senior echelons, there were very few
          women: only 48% of companies had at least one woman in senior
          management, and less than a third had women in top executive positions
          (see figure IV).

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The glass ceiling at senior managerial levels has created occupational
          segregation within management functions. As of 2018, even though 63%
          of surveyed enterprises had at least one female middle manager and
          close to 50% of surveyed enterprises had at least one female senior
          manager, when looking at their functional responsibilities, women were
          overrepresented in support management functions, such as human
          resources, finance and administration, while managerial posts in the
          areas of research and development and profit-and-loss management,
          which are considered to be more strategic, were generally occupied by
          men.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>

          Variations exist across regions, however, with countries in

            >Northern Africa and Western Asia</span

        </p>
        <p>
          The link between the size of a company and the likelihood that it will
          have a woman as CEO is not straightforward. While large companies have
          higher profiles, and may thus be less likely to discriminate against
          women candidates for top managerial positions, they also tend to be
          more hierarchical, making it more difficult for women to reach those
          positions as they may fall behind men in terms of networks, training
          and relevant job experience.<span class="footnote-index">9</span>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="ND1_12">
        <p>
          Furthermore, recent evidence shows that the proportion of enterprises
          with a female CEO shrinks as the size of an enterprise grows: over 26%
          of small enterprises (employing 2–100 workers) have female CEOs,
          compared with 20% of medium-sized enterprises (employing 101–250
          workers) and 16% of large enterprises (employing more than 250
          workers)<span class="footnote-index">10</span> (see figure VI).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="ND1_13">
        <p>
          This argument is also supported by the historical data on the number
          of female CEOs on the list of the Fortune 500,<span
            class="footnote-index"
            >11</span
          >
          which shows the largest corporations in the United States of America.
          While the list from 2020 has more female CEOs than ever before, women
          only account for 7.4% of the total number: only 37 out of 500 CEOs are
          women (see figure VII).
        </p>
        <p>
          While this shows an improvement from 1998, when only 1 out of the top
          500 corporations had a female CEO, the gender gap remains significant
          and is even more pronounced than among large enterprises, where in
          2018 the share of women CEOs was reported at 16% (figure VII).

        <p>
          In 2018, enterprises where women accounted for 30% to 39% of the
