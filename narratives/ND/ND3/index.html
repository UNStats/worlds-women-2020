                <li>Women’s representation among cabinet ministers has increased almost four-fold over the last 25 years, although in 2020, on average, only one in five ministers (22%) is a woman.</li>

                <li>Progress in women’s representation among regions over the past 15 years has been uneven, reaching 39% in Western Europe but only 6% to 16% in Northern Africa, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Asia.</li>

                <li>While progress in selected countries since 1994 has been significant, and the number of countries with at least 30% of women among ministers increased from 5 to 51, in 2020 gender parity (around 50%) among cabinet ministers has been reached or surpassed in only 14 countries.</li>

                <li>In 2020, female ministers continued to be concentrated in ministries related to family and social issues.</li>

                <li>Very few women get to the top position of power within government.

            <h2>Current situation</h2>
            <p><strong>Women continue to be underrepresented in cabinet appointments in all regions of the world.</strong>In 2020, the share of women among cabinet ministers was 22%.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> Although this figure is low, it shows important progress since 1994, when the average share was only 6%.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

            <p>Progress among regions over the past 15 years has been uneven: by 2020, the highest level of representation of women among ministers, at 39%, was reached in countries in Western Europe. The share of women among ministers remained low, at 16% or less, in <span class="label-ref" tag="Northern Africa and Western Asia">Northern Africa</span> and <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) , and only between 6% and 16% of ministers were women in Asia (all regions) (see figure I).</p>

            <p><strong>Progress in selected countries since 1994 has been significant.</strong> Between 1994 and 2020, the number of countries with no female minister declined notably, from 59 countries<span class="footnote-index">3</span> to 9.<span class="footnote-index">4</span> Over the same period, the number of countries with 30% or more women ministers increased from 5 to 51.</p>

            <p>By 2020, gender parity (around 50%) among cabinet ministers has been reached or surpassed in only 14 countries however: Spain (66.7%), Finland(61.1%), Nicaragua (58.8%), Colombia (57.9%), Austria (57.1%), Peru (55.0%), Sweden (54.5%), Rwanda (53.6%), Albania (53.3%), France (52.9%), Andorra (50%), Costa Rica (50%), Canada (50%) and Guinea-Bissau (50%) (closely followed by South Africa (48.3%), Ethiopia (47.6%) and El Salvador (47.1%)).</p>

            <p>Looking at recent progress, the largest increase in the proportion of women among ministers was in Ethiopia, where the share of women in top positions rose from 10% in 2017 to 47.6% in 2020. At the other end of the spectrum, the greatest decrease in the share of female ministers took place in Slovenia during the same time period, where the proportion fell from 50% to 23.5%.</p>

            <h2>In 2020, portfolios held by female ministers continued to be those related to family and social issues</h2>
            <p>In general, women continue to be assigned to portfolios related to social issues, including those related to the family, children, youth, older persons and persons with disabilities and social affairs. Portfolios related to the environment, national resources and energy, employment and labour and vocational training are among the top four ministries led by women. Women’s affairs, which includes the gender-equality portfolio, occupy the fifth position. In 2020, fewer female ministers held portfolios related to transport; population; information and the media; and parliamentary affairs (see figure II).</p>

            <p>More detailed data available for selected countries<span class="footnote-index">5</span> show that, in 2017, the only countries with a 50% representation of women among core ministers of State<span class="footnote-index">6</span> were Canada, Norway and Slovenia; women occupy 40% of cabinet positions in Iceland and Sweden.</p>

            <h2>Heads of State or Government</h2>
            <p>By holding the highest positions in the political sphere, women can also influence social norms and attitudes towards gender equality. However, very few women get to the top position of power within their government.</p>

            <p>As of 1 January 2020, only 10 out of 152 elected Heads of State worldwide were women, and only 13 of 195 Governments were headed by women (see table). The total number of countries with a female Head of State or Government was 21, a slight improvement over the 12 countries with a female Head of State in 1995. In 2020, most countries with female Heads of State were in Europe, which is a change from 2015, when women led Governments in several countries both in Europe and in Latin America and the Caribbean.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
