        <h1>Key points</h1>
        <ul class="key-points">
          <li>
            In 2020, women are free under the law to participate in political
            activity in all countries worldwide, although significant obstacles
            to their effective access to parliament remain, including: gender
            stereotypes; unequal access to resources and education; unequal
            social and legal status; and violence and harassment perpetrated
            against women in politics and women aspirants to political office.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in
            women’s access to parliament, with slow but steady progress in
            representation over the past 25 years. From 1995 to 2020, the
            proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rose from 11.3% to
            24.9%. Improvement appears to have slowed down, however, since 2015
            – and currently, in 2020, women hold at least 50% of the seats in
            only four national parliaments.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved
            in recent years in Australia and New Zealand, Latin America and the
            Caribbean and Europe and Northern America. However, Oceania,
            excluding Australia and New Zealand, continues to lag behind, with
            only 6% of parliamentary seats being held by women.
          </li>
          <li>
            To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of
            targeted policy and legal measures to increase women’s
            representation in national parliaments. Of the 20 countries with the
            highest percentages of women in parliament, 16 apply some type of
            gender quota.
          </li>
          <li>
            Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary
            hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as president or speaker
            of the house. Although the percentage of female presiding officers
            of parliament almost doubled, from 10.5% in 1995 to 20.5% in 2020,
            it is still too low to influence policymaking effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Women continue to be underrepresented in key decision-making
            positions in parliaments, with the exception of gender equality
            committees, 73% of which are chaired by women.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          Women’s representation in national parliaments and in key
          decision-making positions in parliament is an essential aspect of
          their participation in political and public life: their representation
          is a human right and a prerequisite for genuine democracy,<span

            >1</span
          >
          sustainable development and peace.<span class="footnote-index"
            >2</span
          >
          The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women contributes
          to good governance and gender equality in society.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stronger presence of women in parliament and in parliamentary
          leadership allows for the prominent placement of their concerns on
          political agendas, and for the introduction of fresh priorities
          through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws relevant
          to women’s issues.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> The full
          political participation of women requires that they occupy key
          positions of influence, as envisioned by the Plan of Action for
          Gender-sensitive Parliaments adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union
          in 2012.<span class="footnote-index">4</span>

          Women face discrimination within the family, the economy and society,
          as well as under the law. A male-dominated political culture,
          persisting gender stereotypes that confine women to the private
          sphere, unequal access to resources and education, unequal social and
          legal status and violence and harassment perpetrated against women in
          politics and as aspirants to political office need to be tackled in
          order to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to
          access political office.<span class="footnote-index">5</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As emphasized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, increasing attention
          has been paid to instances of sexism, harassment and gender-based
          violence against women parliamentarians that may dissuade other women
          from pursuing a political career and undermine the full participation
          of women elected to parliament in decision-making processes.<span

          From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of parliamentary successive 5-year
          span, reaching a growth rate of 3.2% between 2010 and 2015. However,
          from 2015 and 2020, the rate of increase slowed down to 2.7% (see
          figure I).

          In 2017, Australia and New Zealand surpassed the 30% mark in the
          proportion of parliamentary seats held by women for the second time,
          after first reaching that threshold in 2010. In 2019, Latin America
          and the Caribbean became the second region to surpass the 30% mark,
          followed by the Europe and Northern America region in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, the share of women in national parliaments was the highest in
          Australia and New Zealand (35.1%), followed by Latin America and the
          Caribbean (32.1%), Europe and Northern America (31%) and Central Asia
          (25.4%). The other regions were below the global average,
          significantly so in Western Asia (15.6%), Southern Asia (17.3%),
          South-Eastern Asia (20.4%) and Eastern Asia (21.6%). Moreover,
          although minor improvements have been noted over time, the lowest
          share of women in parliament, 6.2%, continues to be in the
          <span class="label-ref" tag="Oceania">Oceania</span> region, excluding
          Australia and New Zealand.

          Countries that have adopted special measures generally have higher
          numbers of women in parliament. While in 1995 only two countries had
          adopted legislation ensuring gender quotas<span class="footnote-index"
            >7</span
          >
          for parliamentary elections (Argentina and Nepal), by 2020 over 80
          countries had done so.<span class="footnote-index">8</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, overall, women won 25.8% of seats in 68 parliamentary
          chambers up for renewal in 55 countries.<span class="footnote-index"
            >9</span
          >
          In the 40 chambers that applied quotas – either legislated or
          voluntarily applied by political parties – women gained, on average,
          30.3% of seats. In the remaining 28 chambers, which did not apply any
          form of quota, only 17.9% of seats were won by women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other key factors include policies to promote women’s recruitment by
          political parties, strong women’s movements, including women’s youth
          groups, awareness-raising efforts and a more gender-sensitive
          political culture.

          Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary
          hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as president or speaker of
          the house. Once elected, women parliamentarians need to hold positions
          of power and authority and participate in committee work if they are
          to influence policy direction. They also need to be positive role
          models for other women, work to change parliamentary procedures and,
          ultimately, support women’s rights and pursue gender equality (see
          table 2).

          Available data for 2020 shows a contrasting picture of women’s

          foreign affairs, defence, finance, human rights and gender equality
          committees combined, but their share varies significantly by committee
          type, from 73% of gender equality committees to just over 10% of

              Gender quotas, which aim to reverse discrimination in law and
              practice and to level the playing field for women in politics, are
              numerical targets that stipulate the number or percentage of women
              that must be included in a candidate list or the number of seats
              to be allocated to women in a legislature. Gender quotas may be
              mandated in the constitution, stipulated in national legislation
              or formulated in a political party statute. (⇡ back to text)
