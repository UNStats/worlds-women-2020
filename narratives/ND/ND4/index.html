            Women continue to be underrepresented among senior-level civil
            servants: they represented less than 50% of senior-level civil
            servants in 60% of the 27 developed countries with available data
            for the period 2008–2017.

          <li>
            As of June 2020, about a quarter (24%) of national statistical
            offices worldwide were headed by women, close to the proportion
            observed in 2015.

            Women are underrepresented among senior professionals and managers
            within the United Nations system. Women occupied 44% of the total
            number of appointments for a period of one year or more, an
            improvement compared to 32% of appointments in 1997. However, their
            representation is higher at the junior professional levels (above
            50%) and declines at higher senior professional and management
            levels (between 30% and 40%).

          Women tend to be underrepresented among senior-level civil servants,
          including government administrators, administrators at
          intergovernmental organizations, ambassadors and consuls-general.
          During the period 2008–2017, the representation of women at
          senior-level civil servant positions was below parity in 60% of the 27
          developed countries with available data (see figure I).
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the past,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> rates of
          representation varied widely across countries, ranging from 16% to
          77%. Among the four countries with the highest proportions of women as
          senior-level civil servants (above 60%), Hungary (76.6%), the Russian
          Federation (61.5%), Bulgaria (61.1%) and Latvia (72%), only the latter
          exceeded 60% of female representation for the first time. Women’s
          representation among senior-level civil servants is the lowest, below
          20%, in Belgium (17.2%) and Luxembourg (16.1%).

          Chief statisticians are high-ranking administrators in charge of
          national statistical offices, which are responsible for producing
          official statistics in countries worldwide. As at 2 June 2020, 24% of
          national statistical offices (52 out of 215) had a woman as chief
          statistician, very close to the proportion observed five years ago. As
          at 2020, in countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, 39% of
          national statistical offices were headed by a female chief
          statistician (see figure II).
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past five years, there has been significant progress in
          Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand): in June 2020, national
          statistical offices in 7 out of 19 countries or areas in the region
          were headed by a woman, while in 2015 there were none.<span

            >2</span
          >
          In contrast, there were no female chief statisticians of national
          statistical offices in Australia and New Zealand.

          The goal of achieving gender parity at all levels among the staff of
          the United Nations is a commitment that is now two decades old. During
          this time, significant progress has been made towards advancing the
          representation of women in the organizations and agencies of the
          United Nations system.
        </p>
        <p>
          As at 31 December 2018, the latest available data from across all
          entities of the common system showed that, among senior professionals
          and managers, women occupied 44% (out of 109,589 total staff) of the
          total number of appointments for a period of one year or more, an
          improvement compared to 32% of appointments (out of 15,192 total
          staff) in 1997.

          The achievement of the goal of gender parity has remained slow and
          uneven however. The representation of women continues to be higher at
          the junior professional levels<span class="footnote-index">3</span>
          (above 50%) and declines at higher senior professional and management
          levels<span class="footnote-index">4</span> (between 30% and 40%).

          with a 40% representation of women – a direct result of the commitment
          of the Secretary-General to reach parity at the highest levels by
          2021. At the very top of the hierarchy, however, no woman has been
          appointed Secretary-General since the establishment of the United
          Nations in 1945.

          As of December 2018, 34.6% of heads and 48% of deputy heads of United
          Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were women, a
          record number. In addition, in 2018, the Secretary-General appointed
          the first female Under Secretary-General for Political and
          Peacebuilding Affairs, and three female special envoys.<span

          Nevertheless, despite these appointments, the proportion of female
          staff in Field Services, who are generally recruited internationally
          to serve in a civilian capacity at field missions, was significantly
          lower (27%). Furthermore, in 2019, out of approximately 95,000
          peacekeepers, women comprised only 4.7% of military personnel and
          10.8% of police personnel at United Nations peacekeeping
          missions.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
