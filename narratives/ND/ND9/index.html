          Women’s rights to political participation on equal terms with men and
          to shared power between women and men in decision-making bodies at all
          levels of government have been recognized in international normative
          frameworks<span class="footnote-index">1</span> and emphasized in the
          Beijing Platform for Action.<span class="footnote-index">2</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          While the majority of research and global data collection on women’s
          representation in decision-making positions has been focused on
          national parliaments, the inclusion of women in local governments
          positions in the SDG monitoring framework acknowledges the importance
          of a whole-of-government approach to sustainable development and of
          women’s voices and leadership at the local as well as the national
          levels of government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women in local government decision-making positions represent a much
          more numerous and diverse group, and research shows that they redefine
          local priorities by being more inclusive,<span class="footnote-index"

          As at 1 January 2020, as shown in the data available for 133 countries
          and areas worldwide, women held 36% of elected seats in local
          deliberative bodies. While women’s representation at the local level
          was higher than in
          <a href="#ND6" class="narrative-ref">national parliaments</a>
          (25%),<span class="footnote-index">6</span> it was not yet close to
          parity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women’s representation in local deliberative bodies was at 40% or
          above in only a minority of countries (15%). In the majority of
          countries (53%), levels of women’s representation were reported at
          levels between 10% and 30%, and in 12% of countries women’s
          representation was less than 10%, a distribution similar to that
          observed for women’s representation in national parliaments (see
          figure I).

        <p>
          Women’s representation is highest in countries in the

            >Europe and Northern America</span
          >
          (35%) regions, driven, in particular, by high levels of women’s
          representation in countries with large numbers of councillors, such as
          <span class="label-ref" tag="France">France</span> and
          <span class="label-ref" tag="India">India</span>, while lowest in

          (18%) region (see figure II).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there are countries with gender-balanced local
          deliberative bodies in almost all regions. Women’s representation is
          over 40%, for example, in: Antigua and Barbuda (67%) and Bolivia
          (Plurinational State of) (50%) in Latin America and the Caribbean;
          Belarus (48%) and Iceland (47%) in Europe; Uganda (46%) in Africa; New
          Caledonia (46%) in Oceania; and India (44%) in Central and Southern
          Asia.

            >High levels of women’s representation have been reached, in the
            majority of cases, by means of legislated quotas</strong

        </p>
        <p>
          The use of legislated gender quotas has increased women’s
          representation in local governments, particularly in developing
          regions. Legislated gender quotas are temporary special measures
          provided for in national legal frameworks for the purpose of
          correcting historical trends in numerical gender imbalance and fast
          tracking the increased representation of women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worldwide, countries with legislated quotas have higher levels of
          women’s representation in local government (by 7% on average) compared
          to those without quotas.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
          Increases resulting from the adoption of quotas are higher in
          countries in developing regions (11%), particularly in countries in
          sub-Saharan Africa (16%) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (13%).

          <h2>Coverage</h2>
          <p>
            The indicator uses official data on elections results produced by
            national electoral management bodies and reported to the United
            Nations Entity on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women
            (UN-Women) by national statistical offices. As at 1 January 2020,
            data were available for 133 countries and areas, including three
            quarters of all countries with elected local deliberative
            bodies.<span class="footnote-index">8</span>

              is measured as the percentage of elected seats held by women in

              representation in national legislative bodies (specifically in the
              single or lower chambers of parliaments) by focusing on women’s
              representation among the millions of members of local deliberative
              bodies with decision-making power around the world.
