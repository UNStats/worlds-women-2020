Analysis of the mean age at childbearing shows an upward trend in the period since the mid-1990s, resulting in a shorter span of childbearing. Concomitantly, available information on country experiences (see figure III) shows an inverse relationship between contraceptive use and levels of fertility.</p>\n",

There is a strong inverse relationship between contraceptive use and the level of fertility, represented by the total fertility rate (see figure III) over the past three decades.

The observed variations and spread among countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and Central and Southern Asia help to explain why, in spite of the decline in births, levels of fertility are still higher there than in other regions. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, the persistently higher levels of fertility compared to observed levels of contraceptive use may be partly due to the fact that many family planning programmes in the region are promoted as birth-spacing programmes.<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span></p>\n",
