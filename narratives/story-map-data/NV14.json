In Mexico, information on violence against women is collected through the National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships, which has been conducted four times (2003, 2006, 2011 and 2016).</p>\n<p>Since the very first survey in 2003, one of its main the objectives has been to ascertain the level of violence against women in the context of intimate relationships, where the highest prevalence of violence has been reported.
