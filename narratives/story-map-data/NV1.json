Reports from several countries reveal an increase in reported cases of domestic violence to helplines, women\u2019s shelters and the police. In some countries, however, there has been a decrease in the number of reported incidents of domestic violence, possibly owing to the fact that women and girls confined in the home with an abusive partner have limited privacy and may lack access to mobile phones or to the Internet, making it difficult for them to reach out for help.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While as yet there is no solid evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on the percentage of women and girls subjected to intimate partner violence, past evidence has shown that violence is more severe and frequent for those already in abusive relationships when intimate partners spend more time at home (for example, during the holidays). While robust statistics on the impact of COVID-19 are still being produced, there are reasons to believe that the pandemic is likely to increase the risk that women may experience different forms of violence, specifically intimate partner domestic violence: 15 years of survey data show that the great majority of women survivors of violence never report it to the police, helplines or other service providers.</p>\n",

While physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally well defined and measured, this is not the case with psychological partner violence, which may be conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts.

A majority of data come from demographic and health surveys, which typically sample only women and girls aged 15-49. There is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across country surveys: in the case of surveys that interview a sample of women and girls from a different age group, the prevalence for data on the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports violence experienced by ever-partnered women and girls 15-49 years of age.</li>\n\t<li><span class=\"definition\">Physical violence</span> consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose and/or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife.</li>\n\t<li><span class=\"definition\">Sexual violence</span> is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone.
