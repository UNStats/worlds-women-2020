Other factors include increased age at marriage, in particular for women, and the decrease, as a result, in the age gap between spouses,&nbsp;which has reduced the chances of wives losing their husbands at younger ages.</li>\n</ul>\n",

In the last 40 years there has been a slightly higher increase in the proportion of currently divorced or separated women than men aged 45\u201349, both globally and in most geographical regions (see figure I). Worldwide, the proportion of currently divorced and separated persons aged 45\u201349 has remained relatively constant since the 1980s: from 4.5% to 5% for women, and from 3% to 3.2% for men.

The downward trend in widowhood has been steeper for women than for men, and the gender gap has been reduced from 31.1 to 22.3 percentage points. It is possible that the decline in the rates of widowhood for women is due to the fact that men are living longer owing to better overall health and improved health care.</p>\n",

In general, women get married at a younger age than men, thereby creating a gap in the ages of spouses. In addition, women are less likely than men to remarry following a marital dissolution, including through widowhood. Furthermore, survival rates into advanced ages are in favour of women due to lower female than male mortality rates.

Globally, the proportion of widowed women in this age group (29%) is about four times that of men (7%). The decline in these proportions, at the global level, since the early 1980s, has been steeper for women (11 percentage points) than for men (2 percentage points). Nevertheless, there is still a global widowhood gender gap of 22 percentage points.</p>\n\n<p>At the regional level, marked differences are notable. For instance, in countries in <span class=\"label-ref\">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span>, <span class=\"label-ref\">sub-Saharan Africa</span> and <span class=\"label-ref\">Central and Southern Asia</span> there is a gender gap of over 25 percentage points in the proportion of widowed women and men, and these regions also have the highest proportion of widowed women (32% or more). Europe and Northern America and Australia and New Zealand have the lowest rates of widowed women (23%) compared to other regions.</p>\n\n<p>Since the early 1980s, there has been a decline in the rates of widowed persons (aged 65\u201369), particularly women, in all geographical regions. The largest decline in the proportion of widows aged 65\u201369, ranging between 10% and 19%, have been recorded in Central and Southern Asia (from 52.1% to 33.7%), Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (from 45.3% to 29.7%), Northern Africa and Western Asia (from 48.7% to 34.4%) and sub-Saharan Africa (from 42.2% to 32%). Trends in female widowhood, particularly in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where there was a decline in the 1990s followed by an increase in the 2000s and a subsequent decline, raise the issue of the likely contribution to this phenomenon of excess male mortality due to HIV/AIDS.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span></p>\n\n<p>Declines over the years in the rates of widowed persons reflect improved mortality conditions and the likelihood that men will live longer than in the past. Other contributing factors include women marrying men who are not significantly older than themselves, thereby reducing the chances of wives losing their husbands at much younger ages.<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span></p>\n",

A focus on selected countries with the smallest and largest gaps in widowhood for the population aged 65\u201369 years (see figure IV) shows that countries in Europe and Northern America have a narrow widowhood gender gap (between 3 and 9 percentage points) in comparison to countries&nbsp;in <span class=\"label-ref\">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (between 40 and 49 percentage points). This could be due to the higher survival rates of women over men, coupled with a generally wider age gap between spouses (especially among older persons), and the lower probability that women will remarry after the death of a spouse.</p>\n",
