The main reason for this increase is a large uptake in use of the Internet by men in developing regions, not matched by an equally large uptake in use by women. In developed regions, the gender gap is disappearing, dropping from 5.8% in 2013 to 2.3% in 2019. In developing regions, on the other hand, the gender gap was estimated to have increased from 15.8% to 22.8%, and in least developed countries from 29.9% to 42.8%.</p>\n<p>Data disaggregated at the regional level, available only for 2019, shows that the digital gender gap was markedly high in <span class=\"label-ref\">Central and Southern Asia</span> (51.3%), and substantial in sub-Saharan Africa (33.2%) and Western Asia and Northern Africa (21.2%).
