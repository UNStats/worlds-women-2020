Since then, the enrolment of women has been increasing worldwide at a faster rate than that for men, and by the late1990s the enrolment ratios of men and women reached <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/42bffbd08fb542ecadd0dd43a588c1b9#NE11\" target=\"_blank\">parity</a>, remaining equal until the early 2000s. The global participation of women has since exceeded that of men, shifting gender disparity from a male to a female advantage.

Most tertiary education systems offer a wide range of programmes and pathways, allowing students to achieve a degree in two years or to complete an advanced research degree in seven or eight years. In the light of this variation, the gross enrolment ratio for tertiary education is calculated based on a standard age range of five years, which begins at the end of secondary education.</p>\n<p>The ratio is computed as the total enrolment in tertiary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the target population made up of the five-year age group following graduation from secondary school. While the gross enrolment ratio in tertiary education is useful for computing the volume of participation in tertiary programmes, it is important to note that there are limitations when comparing the actual population coverage across countries owing to: differences in the duration of tertiary education programmes; the enrolment of large numbers of women and men outside the target age group; and high drop-out rates and frequent re-enrolments.</p>\n",
