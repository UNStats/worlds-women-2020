In sub-Saharan Africa, the GPI at the primary level was 0.96 in 2018, whereas the GPI was 0.88 at the secondary level. Similarly, in Western Asia, the primary level GPI was 0.94 versus the secondary level GPI of 0.90. In those countries where girls are severely disadvantaged, gender differences at the secondary level are partly a reflection of cumulative gender disparities at the primary level as well as disparities during the transition to the secondary level.<span class=\"footnote-index\">1</span></p>\n",

The global participation of women in tertiary education has since exceeded that of men, shifting gender disparity from a male to female advantage. In 2018, the GPI of the global tertiary enrolment of women and men stood at 1.14, reflecting a gender disparity clearly in favour of women.</p>\n<p>In most regions of the world, women outnumber men in tertiary education. In 2018, the GPI surpassed the parity range by a good measure in Northern America and Europe (GPI of 1.28), Australia and New Zealand (1.42), Northern Africa (1.17), Latin America and the Caribbean (1.30), Eastern Asia (1.16) and South-Eastern Asia (1.23). Nevertheless, a considerable disparity in favour of men persists in <span class=\"label-ref\">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (0.74)and <span class=\"label-ref\">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (0.84). Overall, there are almost as many women as men enrolled in tertiary education in Central Asia, Southern Asia and Western Asia, but the regional averages conceal a low participation rate among women in several countries within those regions.</p>\n",
