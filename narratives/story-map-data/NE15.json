Female graduates comprise the vast majority of graduates (over 60%) in education, health and welfare, social sciences, journalism and information, and arts and humanities (see figure II), and are particularly prominent in education and health and welfare (70% of graduates). Moreover, gender parity (female share in the range of 45% to 55%) has been achieved among students graduating in natural sciences, mathematics and statistics, as a result of significant gains in <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/11a30d2e3cfb4e428a5124534a0ee81c#NE10\" target=\"_blank\">enrolment in tertiary education</a> in recent decades.</p>\n<p>In contrast, male graduates are the vast majority in two of the three STEM-related fields: information and communication technologies; and engineering, manufacturing and construction. Men were more than twice as likely to graduate in information technologies, and almost three times as likely to graduate in engineering, manufacturing and construction. This pattern is consistent, with women constituting only slightly more than one-third of the world\u2019s STEM graduates, indicating that, despite enjoying better access to tertiary education than ever before, women continue to face challenges in participating in STEM-related fields of study (see figure II).</p>\n",
