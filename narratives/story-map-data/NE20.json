                    "content": "<p>Computer and information science also has one of the largest gender gaps in earnings of any field among women and men aged 25\u201434. Non-immigrant women with a bachelor\u2019s degree in this field make 76% of what non-immigrant men make, and immigrant women make 66% of what immigrant men make. For comparison, in fields like health care, biological sciences, law and engineering, non-immigrant women make at least 86% of what non-immigrant men do, and immigrant women make at least 79% of what immigrant men do. Women\u2019s lower wages and lower likelihood of finding a job relevant to their fields of study may give them less incentive than men to choose to study computer and information science when beginning their tertiary education.</p>\n<p>There are two key barriers to women\u2019s equal representation in STEM in Canada: (a) lower enrolment rates in engineering and computer and information science degrees; and (b) women with STEM degrees having a lower rate of job matches and lower wages than men, specifically connected to gender disparities in the ICT sector.</p>\n",
