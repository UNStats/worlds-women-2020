Baseline reports for these settings were published\u00a0in 2018<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span> and 2019<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span> and estimates will be updated on a biennial basis. The following are key findings on menstrual health and hygiene from the latest estimates.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Schools:</strong></p>\n<p>In\u00a02019, over one in three schools globally (37%) lacked basic sanitation services, affecting an estimated 698 million school-age children. One in five schools either had no sanitation facilities at all or lacked useable facilities, whether improved and/or single-sex, and were thus unable to meet the menstrual hygiene needs of adolescent girls. Furthermore, two out of five schools (43%) lacked handwashing facilities with water and soap, meaning that around 330 million girls in primary and secondary schools lacked water and soap for washing their hands when changing sanitary pads or cloths.</p>\n<p>The 2018 report of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span> found that few countries had specific data on menstrual hygiene and that definitions varied greatly. The report highlighted the example set by countries such as Zambia, where new questions related to education on menstrual hygiene, the provision of sanitary pads and disposal facilities have been integrated into the national Education Management Information System survey. The 2016 survey found that less than half of schools provided education on menstrual hygiene and only one in four provided sanitary towels and receptacles for their disposal.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Health-care facilities:</strong></p>\n<p>In 2019, one in five health-care facilities had no sanitation services: insufficient data were available to estimate the proportion of hospitals or non-hospitals with basic sanitation services. Basic sanitation services in health-care facilities include specific provisions for menstrual hygiene (a receptacle with a lid for disposing of menstrual hygiene materials, and water and soap in a private space for washing). In the 2019 WHO/UNICEF baseline report on water, sanitation and hygiene in health-care facilities,<span class=\"footnote-index\">8</span> just 10 countries were able to report this information. For example, Lebanon collected information on the proportion of health-care facilities that provided water and soap (47% of facilities), privacy (45%) and covered receptacles (35%) in women\u2019s toilets.</p>\n<p>Additional criteria related to menstrual health and hygiene in Lebanon included the provision of painkillers (27%), emergency supplies (24%) and training on the disposal of menstrual hygiene materials (17%). The proportion of health-care facilities with improved sanitation facilities that met the menstrual health and hygiene criteria for basic services ranged from 2% (Comoros) to 100% (Azerbaijan, Kuwait and Montenegro).</p>\n",
