Furthermore, free maternal health care services have been provided in Ghana since 2008 and community health-based planning services have been established at the district level all over the country. Additional evidence is needed, however, to confirm that free maternal health care has increased the overall use of skilled delivery providers by pregnant women.</p>\n<p>More needs to be done to improve awareness of the availability of free maternal health care, so that every pregnant woman, irrespective of wealth, education, place of residence or traditional norms and beliefs, will be aware of her ability to visit the hospital or health-care facility for antenatal care and to receive skilled medical assistance there at the time of her delivery.</p>\n",
