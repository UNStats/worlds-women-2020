Furthermore, even when domestic violence laws exist, they are not necessarily implemented, or implemented in a form that helps the victims in substantive ways.</p>\n<p>In many cases, victims and survivors of domestic violence are economically dependent on their intimate partners and the conviction and/or imprisonment of perpetrators often leaves victims deprived of their one source of economic support. In the light of these factors, domestic violence laws need to be implemented in tandem with measures for the economic empowerment of women, including, in particular, appropriate social support mechanisms for those who take the difficult step of seeking legal recourse.</p>\n",

In other instances, a marital (or equivalent) relationship may be explicitly cited in the law as an aggravating factor. Explicit criminalization of marital rape is recommended as best practice by, among other bodies, the Council of Europe. (\u21e1 back to text)</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",
