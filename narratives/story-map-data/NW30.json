Many individuals had to change, cancel or reorganize planned activities, focusing their energies on work within the home, devoting time to matters that had been postponed or seizing the opportunity to express creativity and experiment with new activities: the variety of everyday chores and activities that occupied people during lockdown is rich and heterogeneous (see figure IV). Most people found that they had free time to devote to recreational activities, while more than three quarters had household and family-care activities to do; only 28% went out for a walk, went to work or went shopping for food. Work and educational activities engaged 16.7% and 8% of the population, respectively. No significant gender differences were recorded in daily activities, apart from unpaid household work.</p>\n\n<p>While there is a pronounced and continuing gender gap in terms of unpaid household work in Italy (see figure IV), there has been a growing tendency in recent years for men and women to share domestic chores and childcare. During the lockdown, with couples spending longer periods of time together at home and the increased burden of childcare resulting from the closure of schools, domestic chores were shared to a greater degree, although not to such an extent as to obviate the gender gap in household responsibilities.</p>\n",

Overall, there was a strong gender gap in this regard, with women more involved in this activity (82.9%, compared to 42.9% of men). However, in a third of households, meals were prepared by both sexes, without significant gender differences.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, during the lockdown some gastronomic traditions were rediscovered, such as baking pizza, bread or cakes (53% of the population aged 18 and over). While the percentage was higher among women (69.6%), the percentage among men was also sizable (37.3%). The preparation of fruit jams, vegetables or family food packages also increased during the lockdown.</p>\n\n<p>More than half of the population spent time on housecleaning (54.4%) and 40% reported that they spent more time doing housework than usual. The gender gap was also significant in this area (about 27 percentage points), although lower than that the gap seen in traditional time-use surveys (46 percentage points). The smaller gender gap can be explained by the fact that couples spent a significant amount of time together at home, had fewer work commitments and more opportunities to reconcile the responsibilities of work and family.</p>\n\n<p>Among the usual household work activities, shopping during the pandemic involved fewer people (only 1 person out of 10), but it proved, once again, to be an activity more equally distributed between men and women. As was to be expected, about one in two people reported that they had spent more time shopping than they had done before the lockdown, mainly because of the queues.</p>\n\n<p>During the month of April 2020, 85.9% of the population with children between 0\u201314 years (or 7.9% of the population as a whole) reported being involved in childcare activities. The constant presence of children in the home, and the need to monitor and assist them with distance learning, strongly affected the activities of both parents. Indeed, 67.2% of people involved in this activity indicated they spent more time than in the past on care work, with a very similar rate of increase for both sexes.</p>\n",

                    "content": "<p>Enforced confinement encouraged a substantial share of population to spend part of their free time on activities such as house maintenance, board games and practicing artistic activities, including painting, singing and writing (see figure VI). Household maintenance activities engaged 41% of the population, and 22.3% carried out such activities on a weekly basis. Almost a third of the population devoted time to gardening or garden care (27% at least weekly); 17.3% of people sewed, embroidered or knitted (10.9% at least weekly); and 12.8% dedicated themselves to the restoration of furniture or household items (5.4% at least weekly).</p>\n\n<p>Men were more active in activities related to do-it-yourself projects, such as the restoration of furniture or objects for the home (15.9% of men versus 10% of women) or in home-maintenance work (49.7% of men versus 33% of women). Women, on the other hand, were mainly involved in tailoring/embroidery/knitting activities (28.7% of women versus 4.9% of men). No gender differences were observed in gardening or in taking care of vegetable gardens. Taking into account the frequency of free-time activities practiced compared to 2015 (on a weekly basis), there was an increase of at least 50% overall, with the exception of sewing and embroidery, where the rate of participation remained stable.</p>\n",
