An unintended or unwanted pregnancy may be a pregnancy too early in life, too soon after a previous pregnancy or after a family has been established at a desired size. Like any pregnancy, unwanted pregnancies carry the risk of disability or even death, but they also have added health risks due to the possibility that a woman may choose to have an abortion, and that it might be unsafe. Unlike abortions carried out by skilled personnel in a medically safe environment, unsafe abortions carry a very high risk of complications.</p>\n<p>Between 2010\u20142014, on average, 56 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year,<span class=\"footnote-index\">15</span> of which around 25 million were unsafe.<span class=\"footnote-index\">16</span> Between 4.7% to 13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion.<span class=\"footnote-index\">17</span> Over half of all estimated unsafe abortions globally were in Asia.
