Globally, the share of women among the population aged 65 and older is 54%, and at the regional level, the share ranges from 51% in <span class=\"label-ref\">Central and Southern Asia</span> to 56% in <span class=\"label-ref\">Europe and Northern America</span>. The proportion of women among the population aged 80 and older is even higher both at the global level (62%), and at the regional level (ranging from 55% in Central and Southern Asia to 64% in Europe and Northern America). This high proportion of women among the older population is due to their survival advantage over men.<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span></p>\n<p>Increasing life expectancy at older ages has implications for the living arrangements as well as the health and well-being of older people.<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span> In particular, data show that older women are more likely than older men to live alone due to: (a) their higher <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NP3\" target=\"_blank\">life expectancy</a>; (b) higher prevalence of widowhood among women; and (c) higher prevalence of remarriage among men after <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/a561bd3799104b75b968038fce5fd052#NP22\" target=\"_blank\">widowhood or divorce</a>.</p>\n<p>As the length of life and thus the proportion of older people in the population increase in many countries, it is important to examine whether this is accompanied by sustained health, decent quality of life and sufficient social and economic resources. Research shows that both the prevalence and severity of disability increase with age. In <span class=\"label-ref\">Australia</span>, data show that older women are more likely than older men to have a profound or severe <span class=\"label-ref\">disability</span>: 66.4% of women aged 90 years and over, compared with 48.9% of men aged 90 years and over.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> This points to the fact that as more women live to advanced ages, they require greater care and assistance in activities related to daily living, and long-term care always has costs, even when such care is provided by family members\u00a0on an <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"https://worlds-women-2020-data-undesa.hub.arcgis.com/app/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826#NW25\" target=\"_blank\">unpaid basis</a>.</p>\n<p>Since all regions are experiencing growth in the proportion of older people at advanced ages, the need for long-term care will be critical, including in countries where crucial preconditions for care and healthy ageing, such as universal access to water, sanitation and electricity, as well as robust primary health-care systems, are often lacking.<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span> In addition, as people live longer, and women in particular, they are at higher risk of living in <span class=\"label-ref\">poverty</span>. For instance, in sub -Saharan Africa, households headed by older women are more likely to be poor than households headed by older men; and in more developed countries, older women in one-person households are more likely than older men to be living in poverty.<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span></p>\n",

Worldwide, 24% of women and 12% of men aged 65 and older, and 27% of women and 14% of men aged 80 and over live alone. In addition to the differential in the mortality rate between older women and men, it appears that marital status is a major determinant of the differences in living arrangements between the two groups.<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span></p>\n<p>The proportion of people living alone among people aged 65 and older varies widely among regions, ranging between 13% in <span class=\"label-ref\">sub-Saharan Africa</span> to 36% in <span class=\"label-ref\">Europe and Northern America</span>, with developed regions generally having higher proportions of people aged 65 and older living alone than developing ones. Nonetheless, in all the regions, a higher proportion of older women than older men live alone. While less than 9% of men aged 65 and older live alone in four regions (Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Northern and Western Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa), the proportions of women aged 65 and older living alone in these regions range from 13% to 19%. However, the proportion of older women living alone is much higher in Australia and New Zealand (32% of women versus 18% of men) and in Europe and Northern America (36% of women versus 17% of men), about twice that of older men. The gender gap is very small, however, in countries\u00a0in <span class=\"label-ref\">Latin America and Caribbean</span>, with 17% of women and 15% of men aged 65 and older living alone.</p>\n",
