Since the European Commission recommended the adoption of legislative action to set a gender target for board membership in 2010, the average proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies in the European Union has doubled (from 11.9% in 2010 to 28.8% in 2019).</li>\n<li>In those countries in the European Union with legislative quotas, women\u2019s representation on boards increased by 20 percentage points more than in countries without quotas or related actions.</li>\n<li>Overall, female representation on corporate boards has been growing, particularly in developed countries, although not fast enough: at the current pace, the goal of 30% of women\u2019s representation on boards will not be reached until 2029.</li>\n<li>The representation of women on corporate boards varies across economic sectors. In 2019, the financial sector had the highest proportion of companies with at least three women on their boards (45%) while the industrial sector had the largest proportion of companies without female representation at the board level (25%), as was also the case in the information technology (22%) and communications services sectors (22%).</li>\n<li>The \u201cglass wall\u201d phenomenon, which keeps women in support management positions rather than allowing them access to strategic management functions, still exists at the board level.</li>\n<li>While the share of female participation in the boardroom has increased, boards remain largely chaired by men, and in 2018 the share of female board chairs was less than 10% in almost all regions. Even in Europe, where the majority of legislative quotas on female board membership have been implemented, only 6.9% of board chairs are women.</li>\n<li>Data from 2018 show that, across regions, companies with female rather than male board chairs have a significantly higher number of women on their boards.
