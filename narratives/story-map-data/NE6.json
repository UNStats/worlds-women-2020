For example, among poor households in <span class=\"label-ref\">Nigeria</span>, on average, only 80 girls complete primary education for every 100 boys, and only 20 girls for every 100 boys at the upper secondary level, whereas there is gender parity among boys and girls from wealthy households.</p>\n\n<p>Among relatively richer countries, gender disparities in performance tend to be to the disadvantage of boys, and, to a greater extent, boys from poor households, possibly because of the greater pressures on poor male students to enter the labour market.<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span> In Thailand (an upper-middle income country), for example, roughly 140 girls for every 100 boys from poor households complete upper secondary education, while there is gender parity among the rich.</p>\n",
