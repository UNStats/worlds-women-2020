In 2016, 79% of suicides occurred in low-income and middle-income countries.<span class=\"footnote-index\">10</span> In relative terms, developed regions are more affected, with particularly high suicide rates for men and, to a lesser extent, for women (see figure II). The highest suicide mortality rate is reported among&nbsp;men&nbsp;in <span class=\"label-ref\">Europe and Northern America</span> (26 deaths per 100,000). Europe and Northern America is the region with the largest gender gap in the suicide mortality rate, with men being more than 3.5 times more likely to die due to suicide than women (7.2 deaths per 100,000 for women). The second highest suicide rate among men is in Australia and New Zealand (19.2 deaths per 100,000 for men and 6.9 deaths per 100,000 for women).</p>\n\n<p>The highest suicide mortality rate among women is reported in <span class=\"label-ref\">Central and Southern Asia</span> (11.5 deaths per 100,000 for women compared to 14.4 deaths per 100,000 for men), a region with one of the lowest gender gaps observed.

Worldwide, the lowest suicide mortality rates, for both men and women, are in Northern Africa and Western Asia, where the rate is 6.8 per 100,000 for men and 2.5 per 100,000 for women, revealing a sizable gender gap (men in Northern Africa and Western Asia are almost three times as likely to die from suicide than women).&nbsp;</p>\n",
