Formal laws in 60% of the countries reporting data on gender equality in land rights do not acknowledge customary land tenure systems, but in those that recognize customary laws, less than half protect women\u2019s land rights.</p>\n<p>One key way to support the implementation of policies and laws and accelerate gender equality in land ownership and control is the adoption of temporary special measures, such as legal provisions that allocate financial resources for facilitating women\u2019s purchase of land or adopt mandates to foster women\u2019s participation in land governance institutions. Nevertheless, there is little evidence of the existence of such positive measures in national legal frameworks, and among the reporting countries, the existence of such positive measures is more the exception than the rule. Of the 15 countries reporting data, only <span class=\"label-ref\">Colombia</span> has provisions that allocate financial resources with the purpose of increasing women\u2019s ownership and/or control of land (Proxy D).

However, in 77% of reporting countries, the consent of both spouses is required for land/property transactions (see figure II).</p>\n<p>Although many countries have introduced legal provisions to promote gender equality since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995, substantial progress is still needed to realize women\u2019s land rights in law and in practice.</p>\n",

In India, only 6% of women engaged in crop production had land registered under their name in 2012; for men, this share was close to 40%, revealing a gender gap of 34 percentage points in land registration. In Peru, 8% of the female agricultural holders had documents for land they owned or used in 2018, compared to 19% of male agricultural holders \u2014 a gender gap of 11 percentage points. In the Niger, data show a gender gap of three percentage points, with 0.3% of women having title to land they own solely or jointly, compared with 3.6% of men.</p>\n<p>In 2014, only 6% of women in Burkina Faso owned or held use rights over agricultural land owned by their household, compared to 35% of men. In Ethiopia, however, the disparity was much smaller: in 2016, 65% of women had their name on certificates issued for household parcels, either exclusively or jointly, including the rights to sell it or use it as a collateral (compared to 69% of men). Among the countries assessed, <span class=\"label-ref\">Malawi</span> was the only country with a higher proportion of women (47.1%) than men (41.3%) holding secure tenure rights over the agricultural land. While men in Malawi were more likely to have their names on legal documents, women were more likely to have the right to sell and/or bequeath their land.</p>\n",

SDG indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women\u2019s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. SDG indicator 5.a.1 measures the extent to which women are disadvantaged in ownership/tenure rights over agricultural land. SDG indicator 5.a.1 is divided in two sub-indicators: (a) proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"methodology\">\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<h3>Measurement of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 5.a.2</h3>\n<p>Indicator 5.a.2 measures the extent to which a country\u2019s legal framework supports women\u2019s land rights by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span> which has been ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests,<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span> endorsed unanimously by the Committee of Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2012.</p>\n<p>The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are as follows:\n                        </p><ul>\n<li>A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives.</li>\n<li>B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions. </li>\n<li>C: Women\u2019s and girls\u2019 equal inheritance rights. </li>\n<li>D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women\u2019s ownership and control over land. </li>\n<li>E: In legal systems that recognize customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women.</li>\n<li>F: Mandate for women\u2019s participation in land management and administration institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the context of the reporting on the SDGs, in the case of SDG indicator 5.a.2, countries are classified according to the total number of proxies found in primary legislation or in primary and secondary legislation. Given that customary land tenure rules do not exist in all countries nor is customary law  recognized (related to proxy E), for the purpose of computation, a two-scale (or dual) approach has been developed.<span class=\"footnote-index\">8</span></p>\n<h3>Measurement of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 5.a.1</h3>\n<p>Based on the recommendations from seven field tests carried out under the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) initiative,<span class=\"footnote-index\">9</span> three proxies have been identified to measure ownership or tenure rights over agricultural land:\n                        </p><ul>\n<li>1.\tPresence of a legally recognized document in the name of an individual.</li>\n<li>2.\tRight to sell.</li>\n<li>3.\tRight to bequeath. </li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"methodology-coverage\">\n<h2>Coverage</h2>\n<p>Data on the extent of the legal framework for 15 countries. All available data were collected and validated by the reporting countries. As custodian agency, FAO carried out the quality assessment and aggregation of results.
