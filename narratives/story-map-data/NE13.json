Over that period, the global participation rate in technical and vocational programmes rose from 2.4% to 4.4% for girls and from 3.0% to 5.0% for boys (see figure I). In terms of progress of girls, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) saw miniscule growth (less than half of one percentage point) over the same period. Northern Africa, Europe and Northern America displayed modest growth (between one and one and a half percentage points). Girls\u2019 participation increased by three percentage points or more, however, in Central Asia (8.5 percentage points), Eastern Asia (6.0 percentage points), South-Eastern Asia (3.3 percentage points), Western Asia (5.8 percentage points) and Latin America and the Caribbean (3.0 percentage points). Participation substantially declined for both girls and boys in Australia and New Zealand, the only region to see a decline over the period 1990\u20132018.</p>\n",
