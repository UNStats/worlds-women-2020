The most significant progress has been achieved at the highest levels of decision-making and responsibility,<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1598824414928\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">5</a></span> with a 40% representation of women \u2013 a direct result of the commitment of the Secretary-General to reach parity at the highest levels by 2021. At the very top of the hierarchy, however, no woman has been appointed Secretary-General since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.</p>\n<p>As of December 2018, 34.6% of heads and 48% of deputy heads of United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were women, a record number. In addition, in 2018, the Secretary-General appointed the first female Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and three female special envoys.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1598824434211\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">6</a></span> Nevertheless, despite these appointments, the proportion of female staff in Field Services, who are generally recruited internationally to serve in a civilian capacity at field missions, was significantly lower (27%). Furthermore, in 2019, out of approximately 95,000 peacekeepers, women comprised only 4.7% of military personnel and 10.8% of police personnel at United Nations peacekeeping missions.<span class=\"footnote-index\"><a data-storymaps=\"MJ-ACTION-1598824442162\" data-storymaps-type=\"navigate\">7</a></span></p>\n",
