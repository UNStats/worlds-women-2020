Children who never enter school will have no exposure to formal education at all and will bear the attendant lifelong consequences.</p>\n<p>Children, adolescents and youth who are not enrolled in school are often those from poor households and from socially marginalized communities, including children with disabilities, and from ethnic-minority communities, rural areas and areas with conflict. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Education is essential to the achievement of the SDGs: it will not be possible to achieve universal completion of primary and secondary education by 2030 (SDG Goal 4) without tackling the problem of out-of-school children, adolescents and youth.</p>\n",

In Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), Northern Africa and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, gender inequality affecting girls, indicated by a GPI greater than 1, is evident at every level of education. In Europe and Northern America, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, boys are more likely than girls to be out of school. In the case of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, these disparities are most pronounced at the upper secondary level, when boys tend to drop out at a significant rate.
