At ages 65\u201474, men are more likely than women to die as the result of falling (58% of deaths), however, as women and men grow older (ages 75\u201484 and ages 85\u2014100) the death rate from falls is approximately equal between the sexes.</p>\n<p>Among the older population, tuberculosis takes a greater toll among older men: 66% of deaths at ages 65\u201474 and 69% of deaths at ages 85\u2014100 from tuberculosis occur among men. Women at older ages continue to die from breast and cervical cancer, and they die at higher rates than men from rheumatic heart disease (see figure IV). At ages 65\u201474, women account for 59% of global mortality from rheumatic heart disease, and represent 57% of global mortality at ages 75\u201484. After age 84, deaths due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of dementia are more common among women than men \u2014 56% of female mortality at ages 85\u2014100. Among the oldest age group (ages 85\u2014100), mortality due to stroke, ischaemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, endocarditis and falls are equally common among women and men.</p>\n",
