These data suggest that, in general, women and men divide their time more equally in caring activities than they do in domestic ones, although this is not the case in all regions (see figure I).

Unpaid work refers to unpaid domestic work, care work as well as community or volunteer work, while <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW1\" target=\"_blank\">paid work</a> refers to work activities for which a person earns a payment or makes a profit. Based on data from 82 countries for the period 2001\u20142018, on average, women spend slightly under 7 hours per day and men about 6 hours and 20 minutes per day doing paid and unpaid work, resulting in women working 38 extra minutes each day.</p>\n\n<p>At the regional level (see figure II), gender differences in terms of the total work burden are not large. The smallest gender differences were in Central and Southern Asia (where both men and women work about 6.5 hours, on average, with women working 21 extra minutes per day) and in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (where both men and women work about 7 hours, on average, with women working 33 extra minutes per day). The largest gender differences were observed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where women work almost 7 hours per day and men 6 hours per day, with women working extra 53 minutes per day. The composition of the total work burden differed by gender, however, with women in all regions spending more time on unpaid work and men spending more time on paid work.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, although the gender gap in total work is minor, it is not a real indication of gender equality: as discussed above, despite indications of improvement over time, women still spend, on average, 3 times as many hours per day as men, and sometimes as much as 11 times more (in Pakistan), on unpaid work. These data indicate that men continue to spend more time than women in paid jobs, while women continue to spend more time at home performing unpaid care work and unpaid domestic work (see figure II). While the gender difference in the average amount of time spent on total work is not as dramatic as for unpaid work, it should not be ignored.

In the absence of provisions in the workplace that grant employees the flexibility to effectively combine paid work and unavoidable unpaid work, women and men may end up stuck in traditional gender roles. In this regard, there are four conventions adopted by ILO that address the reconciliation of work and family life: ILO Convention No. 156 (adopted in 1981) (Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention), which prohibits discrimination of workers based on their family status and calls upon employers to take the needs of such workers into account, including by providing childcare; ILO Convention No. 175 (adopted in 1994) (Part-Time Work Convention), which calls upon employers to provide the equivalent conditions to their part-time employees that are enjoyed by their full-time employees, such as social security, equal hourly wages and the bargaining rights; ILO Convention No. 177 (adopted in 1996) (Home Work Convention), created to improve the employment situation of homeworkers, or as more commonly called, remote workers, by advocating for their equal treatment with onsite employees, including remuneration and access to social security; and ILO Convention No. 183 (adopted in 2000) (Maternity Protection Convention), which advocates for the provision of maternity leave for pregnant and nursing women.

In contrast, ILO Convention No. 175 (Part-Time Work Convention) has been ratified by only 18 countries and ILO Convention No. 177 (Home-Work Convention) by only 10 countries.

The national statistical offices of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Italy have collected data on time use during the COVID-19 lockdown. In the United Kingdom<span class=\"footnote-index\">2</span> it was found that, although there is still a gender gap in unpaid work, with women continuing to do more unpaid household work and childcare than men, there was an observed increase in the proportion of men performing these tasks compared to the period before the pandemic. Thus, the gender gap in the average time spent on unpaid domestic and care work has been reduced during the pandemic (pre-COVID-19, just over two hours per day for men and almost four hours per day for women; during COVID-19, almost 2.5 hours per day for men and about 3.5 hours per day for women). Similarly, although men report spending more time on paid work than women, the gender gap has been reduced during COVID-19 (pre-COVID-19, about 3 hours and twenty minutes per day for men and over 2 hours per day for women, with men working an hour and six minutes more per day; during COVID-19, just under 3 hours per day for men and just over two hours per day for women, with men working 47 minutes more per day, on average). Both men and women reported having more free time for entertainment and socializing during the pandemic, and the gender gap with regard to those activities was also reduced (with men still reporting spending more time on entertainment and socializing than women). The questions in the survey undertaken by Italy\u2019s National Institute of Statistics<span class=\"footnote-index\">3</span> were mainly qualitative (asking people if they spent the same/more/less time on certain activities compared to pre-COVID-19). Overall, 67.2% of respondents reported devoting more time to unpaid care work (both mothers and fathers) than prior to COVID-19. The story on the <a class=\"narrative-ref\" href=\"#NW30\" target=\"_blank\">lockdown and gender in Italy</a> provides more specific details at the country level.</p>\n\n<p>While data from national statistical offices on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of time are still scarce, a recent survey done by the Boston Consulting Group in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America found that since the advent of COVID-19 the amount of time spent on unpaid work has doubled for both working women and men who have children. Nevertheless, on average, women spent 15 hours more per week, or just over two hours more per day, on unpaid domestic and care work compared to men, a marked increase over the 10 hours or more per week (about 1.5 hours more per day) prior to the pandemic.<span class=\"footnote-index\">4</span> In early May 2020, a poll of 18 countries conducted by Ipsos,<span class=\"footnote-index\">5</span> revealed that women have taken on a lot more responsibility for household domestic work and care of children and family during the pandemic. Across the 18 countries, on average, women were 4% more likely than men to say that they strongly agreed that their care load had increased during the pandemic. Mexico had the largest gender gap in responses, with 53% of women strongly agreeing with the statement, compared to only 41% of men.<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span> Additional data collected by the United Nations Entity on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) for six countries in Asia tells a similar story: unpaid domestic and care work has intensified during the pandemic, and women continue to take on the majority of it. In addition, women are also more likely than men to report that they are in charge of unpaid childcare, unpaid adult care and unpaid domestic work, while men tend to focus on tasks like shopping for the household, making repairs and playing with children, which, overall, are less time consuming.<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span></p>\n", "contentActions": [], "creaDate": 1602820081534, "pubDate": 1602820081534, "status": "PUBLISHED", "media": {"type": "image", "image": {"url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826/resources/humberto-chavez-FVh_yqLR9eA-unsplash-woman%20standing%20under%20tree__1602820079846__w1200.jpg", "type": "image", "altText": "", "sizes": [{"name": "humberto-chavez-FVh_yqLR9eA-unsplash-woman standing under tree__1602820079846__w1200.jpg", "url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/6f02cbbfb8d34cb7806d21f4bd14e826/resources/humberto-chavez-FVh_yqLR9eA-unsplash-woman%20standing%20under%20tree__1602820079846__w1200.jpg", "width": 1200}], "display": "fill"}}}, {"title": "<span style=\"font-size:26px\">The value of unpaid work represents up to 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) in selected countries</span>", "content": "<p>In addition to measuring time spent on unpaid domestic work, there is a strong argument for measuring its monetary value.
