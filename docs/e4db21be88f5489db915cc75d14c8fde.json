Country estimates ranged from 0.1% in North Macedonia to 1.0% in Ukraine.<span class=\"footnote-index\">6</span></p>\n\n<p>In general, data availability on sexual violence is higher for dedicated studies on intimate partner violence. However, in recent years, several national statistical offices<span class=\"footnote-index\">7</span> have conducted surveys of violence against women and produced estimated rates of sexual violence perpetrated by non-partners. For example, results from a personal safety survey carried out in Australia in 2016 found that 1.8% of women had experienced sexual violence by a non-partner in the past 12 months, and the 2017 national study on gender-based violence in Mongolia pointed to a proportion of 3.1%.</p>\n\n<p>When looking at sexual violence by age group it is clear that <span class=\"label-ref\">younger women</span> face a greater risk of sexual assault. According to data from justice systems and rape crisis centres in Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru and the United States of America, the incidence of certain forms of sexual violence is closely associated with the age of the victim, in particular violence taking place in schools and colleges.<span class=\"footnote-index\">8</span> The proportion of women aged 20\u201329 who have ever experienced sexual violence by a non-partner since age 15 is an important indicator of non-partner sexual violence.</p>\n\n<p>In the 46 countries for which data are available (see figure II), the proportion of women aged 20\u201329 who have experienced sexual violence perpetrated by someone other than an intimate partner since age 15 ranged from less than 1% in Tajikistan (2014) and Kyrgyzstan (2015) to 4.8% in <span class=\"label-ref\">Colombia</span> (2016).</p>\n", "contentActions": [], "creaDate": 1602517639912, "pubDate": 1602517639912, "status": "PUBLISHED", "media": {"type": "webpage", "webpage": {"url": "https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/gender/worldswomen/2020/violence-nv2-graph-2", "type": "webpage", "altText": "", "display": "stretch", "unload": true}}}, {"title": "<span style=\"font-size:26px\">Data availability and measurement challenges</span>", "content": "<p>The availability of data on sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner is much lower than that for intimate partner violence.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, to collect such data, surveys have relied on different methodologies, used different definitions of sexual violence, formulated different questions and sampled diverse age groups. In addition, willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to cultural context, a factor that can affect reported prevalence levels and the overall comparability of international data.</p>\n\n<p>A further challenge is the formulation of the time frame of \u201cprevious 12 months\u201d in SDG indicator 5.2.2. This is a problem for two reasons: firstly, far fewer countries have measured non-partner sexual violence in the preceding 12 months compared with sexual violence over the lifetime; secondly, in surveys it is often reported that the rate of past-year sexual violence for an aggregate age group of women aged 15 and older is close to zero. This very low point estimate of prevalence makes the assessment of changes over time difficult, particularly when data are presented disaggregated by age.</p>\n\n<p>These factors make monitoring trends at the country, regional and international levels difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts are ongoing to develop international estimates of sexual violence by non-partners that account for methodological differences between studies, which will improve comparisons between countries, and enable the monitoring of trends and inform policies.</p>\n", "contentActions": [], "creaDate": 1602964872723, "pubDate": 1602964872723, "status": "PUBLISHED", "media": {"type": "image", "image": {"url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4db21be88f5489db915cc75d14c8fde/resources/alissa-de-leva-bZ_RkRKE0Po-unsplash__1602964762127__w1200.jpg", "type": "image", "altText": "", "sizes": [{"name": "alissa-de-leva-bZ_RkRKE0Po-unsplash__1602964762127__w1200.jpg", "url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4db21be88f5489db915cc75d14c8fde/resources/alissa-de-leva-bZ_RkRKE0Po-unsplash__1602964762127__w1200.jpg", "width": 1200}], "display": "fill"}}}, {"title": "<span style=\"font-size:26px\">Sources</span>", "content": "<div class=\"references\">\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/women_and_health/violence/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization (WHO), Global Health Observatory, (data repository), Violence against Women</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.statcompiler.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">USAID, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, STAT compiler</a>.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/2/413237_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), OSCE-led Survey on Violence against Women: Well-Being and Safety of Women, 2019</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n", "contentActions": [], "creaDate": 1602964789837, "pubDate": 1602964789837, "status": "PUBLISHED", "media": {"type": "image", "image": {"url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4db21be88f5489db915cc75d14c8fde/resources/clay-banks-GX8KBbVmC6c-unsplash__1602964788433__w1200.jpg", "type": "image", "altText": "", "sizes": [{"name": "clay-banks-GX8KBbVmC6c-unsplash__1602964788433__w1200.jpg", "url": "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4db21be88f5489db915cc75d14c8fde/resources/clay-banks-GX8KBbVmC6c-unsplash__1602964788433__w1200.jpg", "width": 1200}], "display": "fill"}}}, {"title": "<span style=\"font-size:26px\">&nbsp;</span>", "content": "<div class=\"methodology\">\n<h1 class=\"methodology-subtitle\">About the data</h1>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"concept\">Sexual violence</span>: <span class=\"availability\">Any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour, including acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest and sexual harassment. </span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"methodology-availability\">\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"concept\">Non-partner sexual violence</span>: <span class=\"availability\">For the purpose of the analysis of non-partner sexual violence, non-partner sexual violence covers violence committed by someone other than current or former husbands, partners or boyfriends.
