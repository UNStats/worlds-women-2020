Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have made tremendous progress, catching up with developed regions in terms of women\u2019s legal rights.5\nThough still far from reaching universality, significant gains have been achieved in terms of legislation to address the gender pay gap: by 2020, employers were legally required to pay equal remuneration for women and men who performed work of equal value in 48 (34%) Member States and territories in developing regions, compared with just eight (6%) in 1995. However, as of 2020, paid parental leave, available to both mothers and fathers, which, along with maternity and paternity leave, contributes to women\u2019s ability to return to work, has been mandated by law in only seven (5%) countries, Azerbaijan, Chile, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
