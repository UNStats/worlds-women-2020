Comprehensive sexuality education promotes improved sexual and reproductive health-related outcomes, including reduction in HIV infection and teenage pregnancy rates, thus expanding educational opportunities for young women.1 This kind of education also helps students to develop critical thinking, communication and decision-making skills, empowering them to take responsibility and control their actions and to become healthy, responsible, productive citizens. Successful programmes adopt interactive, responsive and participatory methods that challenge young people to find new ways of relating to one another. Such programmes should have a planned and sequenced curriculum across primary and secondary schools, incrementally adjusted to the age, stage and situation of the learner.2\n",

Furthermore, programmes outside school may be the only means of imparting knowledge and life skills education to young people in places where teaching about sexuality and HIV and AIDS in school is highly sensitive or forbidden. Life skills education outside school is likely to be most effective when it complements other services targeting young people. Voluntary and anonymous participation offered by youth drop-in centres can enhance the reach and effectiveness of such programmes. \nMoreover, whether life skills-based HIV and sexuality education is offered inside or outside a formal educational setting, it needs to reflect the fact that girls and boys have different needs and vulnerabilities. Single gender groups, with a teacher or facilitator of the same gender, can foster more open communication on sensitive issues. For example, as part of the \u201cSister 2 Sister\u201d initiative in Malawi, \u201cbig sisters\u201d (older young women) share their knowledge and life-skills experiences with young women aged 15\u201419. Overall, the programme has led to increased knowledge in the areas of sexuality, HIV, condom use, multiple and concurrent partners, age-disparate relationships and health-seeking behaviours, and there is evidence that such knowledge is sustained over time.x\n",
