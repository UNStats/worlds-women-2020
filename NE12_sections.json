Inadequate sanitation facilities for girls, particularly during menstruation, can have a negative effect on their school attendance. Safe and separate sanitation facilities need to be made available in schools to ensure that girls can study in a dignified, gender-equitable learning environment; this will reduce absenteeism and facilitate their continuing enrolment in education through adolescence. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 4.a.1, which monitors the proportion of schools with offering basic services, by type of service, addresses access to single-sex basic sanitation facilities to ensure that education facilities are gender sensitive and provide safe, inclusive and effective learning environments for all.\n",

Among 103 countries with data, in about 20% access to single-sex sanitation facilities at the primary school level was below 75% (more than half of those countries were in sub-Saharan Africa). Access to single-sex facilities was universal in countries in Northern America and Europe, with the exception of Albania, where access was 83%. Access was also universal in the vast majority of countries in Eastern Asia, Oceania and Western Asia and Northern Africa and in about 50% of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Afghanistan and Bangladesh (Southern Asia), Cambodia and the Philippines (South-Eastern Asia), the Marshall Islands (Oceania) and Jordan (Western Asia) less than half of primary schools provided single-sex sanitation facilities.\nCompared to schools at the primary level, the situation reported in schools at the lower and upper secondary levels was improved. Globally, the percentage of schools that lacked single-sex facilities at the lower (13%) and upper (12%) secondary levels compared favourably to the 22% of primary schools with appropriate facilities. Regional patterns of access to single-sex sanitation facilities at the lower and upper secondary levels are broadly similar to those at the primary level, although overall access is somewhat better at those levels of education (see figure).\nStudies of access to sanitation facilities that analyse the situation at the individual country level show that variations in access by region are wide, and that access is more limited in rural schools. For example, in Nicaragua, 64% of urban schools but only 32% of rural schools had improved basic sanitation services.1\n",
