In 2018, only 8.4% of the population aged 6 and over (20.6% of readers, a total of about 4.8 million people) stated that they had read an e-book and/or a digital book available online.

In 1998, 62.7% of the population aged 18 and over read newspapers at least once a week, a share that had dropped to 38.9% in 2019.
