It occurs in school, on school grounds, on the way to school and, increasingly, in cyberspace. Bullying is often perpetrated as a result of gender norms and stereotypes. For instance, girls may experience sexist verbal abuse about their weight, appearance and marriage prospects. School is where children cultivate friendships and form peer groups \u2013 pivotal steps towards adult socialization.1  Relentless and inescapable, bullying affects children and youth in terms of their school attendance, well-being and learning abilities, and can also have a significant impact on their emotional and behavioural development. Children who are bullied are often marginalized by their peers and exhibit risk factors, such as loneliness.2  Providing a safe and inclusive learning environment is critical for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 4. a, which aims to \u201cBuild and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all\u201d.\n",

In countries in developed (high-income) regions, 27% of girls and 30% of boys reported having been bullied. The corresponding proportions for developing (low-income and middle-income) countries were slightly larger \u2014 29% for girls and 34% for boys.\nAnalysis of data from 81 countries shows that, between 7% to 54% of girls and 11% to 56% of boys reported having been bullied by other students at least once in the past 12 months. In 41 countries (about half of the countries with data), the average prevalence rate was less than 30% for both girls and boys; in five countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines), the average prevalence rate for both sexes was 50% or more.

In Recife, Brazil, grade 6 students who had been bullied achieved significantly lower scores in mathematics.4  In Ghana, where bullied grade 8 students also achieved lower scores in mathematics, the effects were worse for female students, although their situation was mitigated when the teacher was a woman.5 \nPreventing and addressing acts of bullying require that governments develop comprehensive, coordinated responses, including appropriate regulations, policy and leadership initiatives, reporting mechanisms, community and student partnerships, evaluations of incidents and staff and teacher involvement.6 Prevention-oriented education programmes that teach students acceptable strategies for interacting with their peers, including skills for understanding interpersonal differences, managing peer pressure and rejecting gender norms have been shown to be effective in preventing acts of bullying.7 Teaching communication and decision-making skills will help students, both victims and perpetrators, to address and ultimately eliminate bullying behaviour.\n",
